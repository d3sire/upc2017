I flew from VIE-IAD I could not stretch my legs seat was hard and uncomfortable cutting into my back legs. I was sore for a week even though I had stood up every 3 hours for a stretch and walk. I complained and their reply was they refurbished the planes with new ergonomic seats for better passenger comfort. What a difference when I flew with Lufthansa last year far better comfort.,bad

This was a major mistake as 22G has a large metal box directly adjacent to the anchor stays of the seat in front so it means that leg space for 22G is reduced by about half. Of course this does not appear on the seating chart at check-in but had I known this I would have stayed in 14A. That said I watched a film directly after the meal service (the second Narnia film) and then woke up just before breakfast. So I must have slept for about eight hours. Perhaps the Narnia film sent me to sleep or KLM's red wine served with dinner.,bad

I was in the one seat row going into Newark and there was about an inch gap between the buckle and the insertion side. I was unable to maneuver it because when I tried to I hit my head so I asked for an extender. While in Newark I became ill and didn't eat for two days. When I boarded the plane to return I was on the side with two seats. The buckle went as far as my naval. The side you insert came as far as the side of my leg. You probably think I weigh 400 pounds. Nowhere near. My heart really goes out to others - I don't know how they coped. I'm never taking United again. They disrespect people.

The seats are on a 30"" pitch - the tightest in the AA fleet and if you are over 5'6"" tall you will be uncomfortable. The only upside is the IFE - every seat has a screen with some content to distract you from the cramped and uncomfortable seats - I would not recommend this aircraft for any flight over 2 hours. To add insult to injury to the frequent flyer there are only 8 first class seats giving a ration of 1 to 14 of first to economy. By comparison the outgoing MD80 had 16 first class seats giving a ratio of 1-8.

Base of seat was hugely uncomfortable after a few hours - seemed to have very little padding. TV screen becomes all but useless if the person in front of you reclines even if you also then recline. On the return leg (LHR to SYD) we were on an older A340 which had the docking position for the entertainment controls on the inside of the armrest making it very hard to remove / replace while sitting down. The aircraft on the flight over had this under the screen which was far more sensible. My reading light seemed to be aimed right in between the seats and couldn't be adjusted.,bad

I think I would go far as to say they are one of the worst transatlantic air lies I have even flown and I fly a lot! The seats were terrible so uncomfortable and you were shoe horned into a tiny space for 11 hours. The food was awful borderline inedible and the staff were ok. Just ok not fantastic service but not awful. TV offerings were not great pretty disappointing especially their offerings for children. The children's food was again inedible meaning my 7 and 4 year old had nothing to eat the entire journey as they didn't even have child snacks for kids like crisps or popcorn. With all the schedule changes (our flight was changed by 3 hours) they did nothing to accommodate us when we complained. In fact their customer service agents at their call centre were down right rude and had no clue. I have to say they are turning into the new Ryanair - nothing to be proud of Virgin Atlantic!,bad

We were in row 8 which had an area in front of us that was used by everyone including crew as a walkway. We tried to get some sleep but were constantly trodden on or kicked.

Bassinet position meant it was impossible for me positioned by window to exit my seat without crawling under the bassinet as no room in front of seats. Entertainment system very good. Oriental meal consisted of coleslaw sandwich. No obvious flight attendant care as passenger walking around cabin just prior to landing. Free strollers from gate to baggage claim. Would not recommend for travelling with babies and infants.,bad

The legroom of economy class seat is very wide with good recline and it has large PTV and USB port for you to charge your smartphone. They still provide basic amenity kit but there is no more slipper socks or eye shades. The airlines allows you to turn on smartphones with flight mode for the entire duration of the flight which is good if you want to listen music or watch movies from your portable devices.,good

Although I reserved a window seat (27A) 2 months before the flight they gave me a seat at the last lane before the toilets located in the middle of the plane. The problem is that none of these seats recline - I mean no recline! Apparently Lufthansa staff does not care to tell passengers that during reservation at the check-in even though you are a Top- Tier flyer (Star Alliance Gold). Besides that this plane had only old TV monitors hung from the ceiling that had no view point from the seat I was. Worst flight for the last 5 years at least!,bad

We were shocked when we boarded the plane and discovered how small and restricted the seats were and how they was virtually no leg room. I'm only a 5'4"" tall female and I had a panic attack when i sat down in my seat next to where the window should be- there was no window I could look out of just the fuselage. I can't describe just how restricted the seat was- it was the sort of seat you would expect to sit in on a budget airline short haul flight not a supposedly reputable airline's long haul flight. The chairs in front were practically on top of us and our chairs hardly reclined so needless to say we didn't get any sleep. We had no idea how small these seats would be. Passengers then tried to go and sit in the empty extra legroom seats as the plane was taxiing towards the runway and some minor disputes occurred. The cabin crew did not have a handle on the situation and to our surprise concentrated on taking extra payment from these customers so they could sit in these seats with apparently extra legroom instead of directing them to return to their seats whilst the plane was moving! Overall this was the worst flight we have ever flown on and we are sorely disappointed that Virgin's standards have plummeted. They are clearly only interested in money making and have no regard for their passenger's comfort or for attracting repeat business.",bad

I did not notice that until days before my flight; otherwise I would have sought a more peaceful seat away from the engine noise of the rear of the fuselage. Anywhere from Row 25 forward would have made a huge difference. I am not sure about the rest of the flying public but I find it hard to sleep when on long flights gaining hours from east to west during the day anyway. I figured that my flight to LA was going to be a push in the sleep department as usual so I just let it roll.,good

Row 36 had a wall behind it but the seat seemed to fully recline and we could store pillows etc behind the seat and no one could kick us. We were close to the galley and toilet but that did not bother us. The seat had the new ICE which was fantastic with a huge range of movies tv shows and music and widescreen monitor. We were not bothered by the 4 seats in the middle it did not seem overly cramped and the lack of a footrest was fine. The recline was very good seat comfortable and I was able to stretch my legs under the seat in front. I am 5'11 and 15 stones. The food was very good and good choice of drinks.,good

I mean the legroom is absolutely dazzling and the seat recline was great (well I'm short) and the shell seat is great because you don't have to have the seat in front of you in your face. If you feel like you're not lucky to be in this small cabin (the upper deck one is the only one on the plane) look at the economy passengers behind you! I felt like how low the seats were made it so that it was a bit difficult to view the screen. But this was hardly noticeable. Again I'm short!,good

As others have also stated this was puzzling because our Denver to Philadelphia leg on an A320 was fine. I was shocked that our international leg to London offered worse comfort than the domestic leg. Makes no sense. I should point out that I am the type who almost never complains about anything and can usually cope with discomfort or inconvenience. I am also relatively tall at 6'/0"" but not unusually so yet all the way to London I had to sit at an angle. It was impossible for me to fit with my knees pointed straight ahead. It wasn't close either. I had to sit at about a 30 degree angle to one side then switch to the other side ad nauseum. By the time we arrived I was in serious pain and discomfort.

As another commentator has stated here there is something about these premium economy seats making them just not that comfortable. Perhaps it's the low placement of the foot rest limited recline fatigued cushioning or the adjustable headrest 'wings' which give way as soon as a head rests upon them. An additional issue is the placement of toilets on this plane none of which are in the premium economy section which might be an inconvenience if the plane is full resulting in more demand and a longer occupancy of the aisles by cabin crew performing their duties. I guess the extra fare does not equate to a proportionally improved flying experience. Cabin crew were excellent.,good

I had the older seats on the DFW-LHR flight to compare them to. LHR-DFW trip the aircraft was about 2 months old but already some cabin wear was visible. Height of the IFE screen is just an inch or two lower than the preferred height mainly due to the design restrictions in the seatback. The normal IFE box found under the seats in older aircraft was gone. IFE system was fair in terms of usability and stability but not perfect. The movie selection was quite nice and the pause/play/options appeared in a natural and quick way. Picture quality was also good. They've added a ""World News"" feature in every IFE that allows full internet connectivity to worldwide news sources (free). My biggest complaint about the new IFE system would have to be the seat recline viewing angle. Whilethe seat recline is very good with the new seats I would define it as ""virtually impossible"" to watch the IFE screen in full-recline of the seat in front of you. The seat itself was average. It's width is reduced compared to older seats (the new configuration is 3x4x3 compared to the previous 2x5x2 configuration) and I'm unsure about the comfort of passengers. Older aircraft are said not to receive these seats until 2014 which is a disappointing fact in terms of AA's quality of service.",good

Very poor seats on the A380. They were hard and not comfortable at all. The seat width was the same width as the Virgin Australia domestic plane and the leg rest was almost impossible to use if the person in front of you reclined their seat. And once they do recline you can't get your bag from off the floor and it's almost impossible to get out of your chair. It's almost as bad as flying the domestic Qantas planes.,good

My legs were cramped on the final leg (Singapore ‰ЫТ Sydney) - knees pushed against seat in front which meant I couldn't rest my head. Flight staff not pleasant on final leg. Chaotic flight staffing on first leg - it was like a mad house - people asking to be re-seated insufficient overhead locker space (someone took up our luggage space before we boarded). Biggest problem - we did not sleep well. Can't blame Qantas but one chap sat next to me snored like a pig throughout the flight - I lost a full nights sleep - the stewards were aware but what could they do!! When table and TV screen in place it was like sitting in a steel box. Need to look at an angle when looking at TV screen - screen pulls out from seat rather than located directly in front. The worst part of the journey was the reclining seat in front. When fully reclined it was impossible to use my tray and virtually impossible for my wife to leave her central seat. All in all an unpleasant experience when compared with Premium Economy with Air New Zealand.ked onto an A380 again unless I win the lottery and can go first class. (probably not going to happen?),bad

Less room and smaller than Air Asia seats. When reclined cannot see the PTV screen as the angle is wrong. Guy next to me was half on top of me. I was in the isle seat and was kept awake the entire trip by people bumping into me. People behind me were banging into the back rest and its impossible to recline because then you are right on top of the person behind. It was a nightmare trip and I had jet lag for days after. My advice is to not travel on this aircraft at all on long haul flight.,bad

This is a middle seat and you are constantly pressing against your neighbours on both sides. There is also a support strut directly in front of you so your feet are in a ""shared"" space.

Seat width was wider than on an A320A330 or A340 and it was a welcome change not to feel so compressed in terms of the seat area and legroom. The downsides however were the constriction from the left side wall tapered inwards from shin to toe and headroom when standing to get out. Cabin felt dated despite the aircraft being younger than 5 years - this came about due to visible cracks in the plastic fittings as well as rather old looking mould on the seat in front and no tv screens anywhere.,good

I was travelling with them as part of a package to the Hong Kong Sevens so didn't have any other alternative. The seats confirmed my worst fears. They are just awful. I'm 6ft 5 and if you choose your seat carefully on line before getting to the airport then you can at least get some leg-room if you're lucky. The real issue is comfort. There simply isn't any as the seat cusion is just too thin. The 'recline' or slide forward motion is awful as well. I had a really sore lumbar on arriving back in London as you can't get comfortable and sleep is nearly impossible in an upright position. Warning! Take a seat and neck cushion. It's hard to believe that this refurbishment was (I hope) researched and tested prior to introduction. If it had surely it wouldn't have progressed.,bad

As a concession AC assigns PE passengers to ""preferred seats"" so in our case this was 12D and 12E which is immediately behind Business Class on this 120-seat aircraft. Boarding this flight was a zoo with many passengers dragging huge carry on luggage and scrambling to find space. As we were in a bulkhead row there is no under seat storage so we also had to scramble to stow our carry ons (just a few small bags by the way). Curiously as the IFES is tied to the seats in front of you that meant there were only two screens for three Economy passengers. The seats have 35"" pitch as opposed to 31-33"" in non -preferred seats. Still not particularly comfortable but it is what it is.",good

Row 36 in economy is reserved for families with babies and so row 36 on the left side of the aircraft is shifted back several cm. As a result row 37 and row 38 have much much less legroom. My knees were pressing into the seat back of row 36 for the entire trip (14+ hours) and the situation was made much worse by the fact that the person seated in 36A jammed the seat all the way back as far as she could giving me even less leg room. My seat mate was a large tall gentlemen and he suffered far more than I did. For both of us the seats in row 37 were claustrophobic. Couple that with the fact that both seats in row 36 have boxes under them that restrict the amount of room people in row 37 have to stretch their legs and you've got the recipe for a very uncomfortable ride.,bad

The aircraft appeared old it did not have the Italian colours but the tail was blue with a design I did not recognize. The seats were filthy stained and with the cover of the back coming unglued. My tray at least was unsteady and it seemed on the verge of detaching from the supporting system. The leg room was sufficient for my height and body type (I am 5'8"" and 170 lbs) but for anyone taller or heavier it would be extremely uncomfortable. The overhead monitor did not work and neither did the sound system. The food its not worth the comment. I think the president of this Airline should definitely consider another line of work.",bad

This was well worth it but still not good. With 10 seats across the seats are so narrow that you can hardly move (I am 1.82 and normal weight) This seems even worse at the exit row as your tv screen and table are stored between the seats. However fortunately you have legroom. I cannot imagine having done a flight on any other seat in the economy cabin as the legroom is really non-existent (I tried it) and together with the lack of width it makes for a combination from hell. My travel partner is 1.72m and even he found it extremely difficult. Moreover a crew member on passive transfer sat on the jump seat facing us and spread her luggage out on the floor during the flight so we could not actually stretch our legs even if we had paid extra for exactly that.,bad

When the person in front of me tried to recline his seat I had to tell him to put the seat back up as my knees were smashed. Why doesn't LH offer a premium economy seat? I will stick with United even with the older planes and poor cabin crew service at least I can have a seat with some leg room. I will avoid Lufthansa's A380 at all cost.",bad

While the seats themselves were nice and comfy the one downside is that if you have your seat up and the person in front reclines you have a TV screen inches from your face which made for a incredibly uncomfortable journey. On the return trip we tried the skycouch (2 adults travelling) and there is much improvement depending on what you want to use it for. We reclined the seats back and put it into 'bed' mode. For us this was fine as my girlfriend was happy to sit upright in the isle seat which allowed me to lay across the 3 seats. The extra width was lovely and made for a far more comfortable journey (even for my girlfriend who was now able to put her feet up also. The people in front did not recline giving us more space but the problem would still exist with the screen being close if they had and because of this I think if 2 people were to lay side by side with the seat in front reclined it would make it more like a coffin for one person. Saying that if you want to take turns with laying out then I would highly recommend paying the bit extra for have more sitting/laying options and generally more comfort. We are flying again with ANZ on the same journey and have booked the hard shell space seat to see if this improves the journey. I could not find a fault with the rest of the airline staff entertainment and food were all first class hence why we are flying again.,good

Without this act of kindness I would have been crippled because the new shell design (non-reclining) is completely insane. Have the cushions slide forward and describing this as the same as reclining is absurd. Your knees end up in your face - try it at home! One can only hope that these things get scrapped and a legitimate engineer designs the new ones.

I paid an extra charge to have more legs room on the emergency exit row but the seat width is a real problem. Any adult with a regular shoulder width will exceed the limits of the seat back. Since seats are to close to each other this means you and your neighbor will travel shoulder to shoulder pushing for space along the whole 12 ours trip.,good

I am only small so the legroom was adequate for me. However the seats were so uncomfortable that I had back pain throughout the whole 8 hours and then a second 4 hour flight. I tried using the airline pillow to ease my discomfort and ended up actually sitting on my own inflatable neck pillow and a blanket. My coccyx feels bruised it was unbearable. The inflight entertainment was good. It wouldn't take much for the crew to actually smile but apparently this was too much effort. Would not use Etihad again.,bad

The seats are in a 3x3x3 arrangement and I had a generous amount of room between me and the person next to me. I was very impressed though that on this 3 hour flight they serve a full meal service in economy. The portions are larger then on my flight from SFO-NRT (12 hour flight) on United. The plane did have western movies in English but very limited choices. Staff were over the top friendly.,good

Using the table in front of me was a struggle during the 8 hour flight over the Atlantic. Even though I booked an aisle seat I had a hard time getting up and sitting down. Poor interior layout... How do they expect people to fly with Swiss again?? Never never again. This airline used to be OK now it is similar to the low level institutions in the industry. Rude flight attendants I do not know if it is the so called Swiss attitude but they are not service oriented. By the way the crowd in the plane was weird. Mostly old people perhaps a sign or a symptom? Stay away at all cost!,bad

The 2x4x2 configuration makes it easy for anyone to get in and out and the seat width and comfort was acceptable and better than many European airlines. Recline was okay and the screen worked well. Leg room was not impressive but on par with most airlines. All in all recommendable.,good

I had an emergency exit/aisle seat so I was extremely happy with my seat leg room and mobility. However seeing the screen for movies was difficult and I was right next to the lavatories so I had people walking past me the entire flight and I could hear every flush. Seat was confortable with a leg rest reclines well and has pretty good width.,bad

The seat in front was a Premium Economy seat. There was no division between the cabins and the space between my Economy seat and the Premium Economy seat in front was the standard space between two Economy rows. But the Premium Economy seat reclined an extra 30%. The passenger in front of me chose to exercise the full recline despite my vocal objections which resulted in a horribly cramped and unbearably uncomfortable flight. The crew were not really interested in my problem. Add to that a plane that needed cleaning properly (really how did the cleaning staff miss a large used paper cup in my seat pocket?) the life jacket under my seat was dangling down on the floor food quality was below average and you can understand why it will be a long time before I set foot on another El Al flight.,neutral

The seats on the sides are angled towards the outside. Leg room is worse than in the previous Premium Economy. All looks very fancy in white (why white? This is going to look grey and shabby very quickly!) but the seats are hard no squab not easy to recline and viewing position awful. Will avoid this class at all costs!,bad

After 2 1/2 hours with my leg twisted my knee hurt quite a bit. I could not put my laptop envelop (not even a briefcase) under the seat. The seat-back storage is almost nonexistent. The seat pitch with the new contoured seats kept me from even opening my laptop that has only a 12-inch screen. My company won't pay for seats with extra legroom so I am stuck in the torture chamber. After 20 years of flying only American if it went where I was going I am looking for an alternative. American you have pushed cramming more bodies into a fixed space too far this time.,bad

AA are still flying old 757-200 on this transatlantic route and we experienced appalling service. Everything about this flight now ranks as my worst ever flying experience. The seat pitch is only 31"" (if that) which is sub-standard on such an important international route for a national carrier. The aircraft lacks personal in-flight entertainment. The positioning of the ceiling tv screens means that passengers in seats A and F cannot adequately view any video entertainment let alone the mandatory safety video. The meal quality was embarrassing for AA. The cabin crew were very unprofessional. Everything about the flight was either poor quality or unprofessional.",bad

Seats are extremely squeezy (not sure why KLM adopted a 3x4x3 seat layout when other long haul airlines rarely do). Recline is absolutely horrendous for a overnight flight - the seat was definitely not suitable for a night's sleep maybe only a short 30 minutes nap. Furthermore KLM's economy class tickets are not cheap - merely cheaper than top notch Singapore Airlines by 120 euros. Therefore I do not get why KLM is so cheapskate to pack so many people in economy class on very poor quality seats. The seats are so cramped that passengers have so much difficulty getting in and out of their seats to use the lavatory! Never on this airline again for long haul flights maybe a short 2-3 hour one.,bad

The issue is the way they recline since the seat slides forward the headrest never allows your head's center of gravity to get behind your solders. This makes it very hard to sleep because your head keeps flopping forward. The other issue with the recline on these seats is that the seat base slides forward making it very hard to extend your legs out under the seat in-front of you. The overall result is a truly uncomfortable slouch.",bad

BA's Premium Economy offer on 747s is very poor. The seats were shabby and dilapidated. Access to the light and call buttons was difficult because the are on the inside of the armrest in a narrow seat. The recline was poor and the screen was small (but good choice of films). Everything else - check in food beverages (including some particularly poor white wine) was standard Economy class .

This past week I flew from DFW to LGA on AA and couldn't get the headrest high enough to support my head and neck but still fell asleep. When I awoke my neck was extremely stiff and I had a severe migraine that lasted 2 days. I simply cannot fly AA again because of the horrible seat design.

The first sector was on the main deck seat 48K (window) 3x4x3 and the next seat on the upper deck 74K (window) 2x4x2. The seats were well designed and ergonomic however the seat cushion was extremely hard probably the worst I have experienced on a longhaul flight. After two hours I was in pain and had to stand up. The seats have foot rests but these are almost useless for a tall person and when those in front are fully reclined it it almost impossible to get out without the people beside you getting up. The upper deck seating configuration in economy is generally much more pleasant typical of A330/A340 cabins.,good

I fly regularly the SIN-Paris leg on Economy and after 5-6 hours my rear is just numb I have to get up to let the blood flow. Not only is the seat hard but the extremely limited incline of the backrest only allows your back to rest in a technically still sitting position. And that is hard for a 12-13 hour journey. I don't understand how SQ could have gotten this part so wrong.,bad

The problem was being an aisle seat people kept bumping into me all night long. Not just passengers but the crew as well. The aisle is only sixteen inches wide. The passengers shoulders protrude beyond the back of the seat. I complained to the crew and they said it was not their fault. They said it was a huge problem for them and the airline just would not listen. I resent being bumped into like this. Normally an airline crew would apologise but I guess if you are bumping into people all the time you would never get any work done apologising all night. Very disappointing when other aspects of the flight were excellent. I checked the ATR aisle width and it is 19 inches. A lot less people and a lot less movement of people about the cabin,bad

Not only has the standard of the food deteriorated but also the standard of cabin service by Emirates staff.  I felt they had no interest in the passengers at all. On my return journey , when I boarded the plane at KL the young woman in front of me had already fully reclined her seat and it was quite difficult to squeeze into mine. When preparing for take off the stewardess didn't even notice the reclining seat. They really don't check properly. As far as I am concerned when the person in front of you fully reclines their seat they are invading the space of the person sat behind. Because of this I had a very uncomfortable 12 hour journey to Dubai. ",bad

The entertainment system was good touch screen and new technology (on the A330). A sorry would've been nice for the FA spilt the cup of tea when collecting my tray just one of the great features of my wonderful flight to London. The FA was more interested in her colleagues night out than unlocking the toilet after take off.,good

However it didn't reach a position which was comfortable. The ""footrest"" was terrible it was really a ""legrest"" that only extended about 2/3 the way from my knees to my ankles but all it did was press against my calves and cut off the circulation. It was also difficult to put back had to press hard against it with my legs while pushing a button on the inside arm of the seat. The table which was stored in the seat arm did not slide forward enough to provide room between it and my stomach - I'm not particularly large so I don't know how someone who is heavier would even manage to use the table. I had to have the seat completely in the upright position to be able to use the table at all and it was rather awkward trying to eat with it that close. Also the seat adjustment buttons are right under where the table hinges so it's essentially impossible to adjust the seat when the table is out. We were sitting in the first row on the right side of the plane so had lots of legroom; I give the normal seats 4 of 5 based on my observation but I'm not very tall so don't need a lot of legroom. The video screen was in the other arm of the seat position when out was OK but not great a little low and of course off center.",good

After being loaded on the plane and being told that we had to wait for 10 mins for connecting passengers to join our flight after sitting for this period the seats then became extremely uncomfortable. Butt and back padding is very slim and had to travel our whole return trip from Rome via Hong Kong to Sydney with the pillow and blanket at my lower back. this made the seat just bearable however frequent moving and getting up standing for multiple periods of time made the trip just manageable.

I purchased the extra legroom seats and was glad I did. The standard economy looked horribly claustrophobic, and premium economy didn't look much more roomy than the seats I'd booked. However, they did look more comfortable as the new seats feel as if someone forgot to put the padding in. However service excellent, and the hot meals I had weren't bad. However, the breakfast was a bit disappointing - a yogurt, granola and a mini muffin. The afternoon tea (a wrap and a biscuit) was good. ",good

What you get is more seat width legroom and recline better service some better food and booze. The problem is that the armrest between the seats takes up a lot of space and cannot be lifted up. So if you travel with kids or even a spouse there's a lost opportunity to get more comfortable. The kids cannot lie with their heads on your lap ever in premium economy.

The seat width however was horrible. First reduced due to the tray table in armrest on top of that the remote for entertainment console is also placed in armrest and the holder pokes about an inch into the seat. Uncomfortable to get in or out of the seat and nearly impossible to reposition yourself without getting out if you are slightly on the heavier side. Better for people who feel comfortable in 16 inch seat width. The entertainment screen is folded on a swiveling arm which folds behind your feet. It was quite hard to move it into position (joints were hard) and amazingly the joint which is supposed to holed the screen upright was super smooth! At initial deployment of the screen I had just started watching something with my legs crossed over each other and the screen fell (swiveled on a horizontal axis at the bottom side of the screen) and hit my shin quite hard. For the rest of the flight I was rubbing my shin (and keeping the blanket folded many times on my leg to prevent any further injury due to the screen). I forgot to mention that the controls in the remote which was poking my thigh did not function. Not just on my seat at least 6 more seats around me had the same issue. Thankfully the touchscreen menu on the personal screen was working which enabled me to watch a movie (not much more as the system response was very sluggish and music browse menu quite user unfriendly to use satisfactorily).,bad

I understand from other reviewers that this was due to the way the airline configures the seating in economy. At best the service was indifferent liberally spiced with rudeness. Despite being a party of 5 we had trouble stowing our 3 standard carry on cases. When the compartment couldn't close the stewardess said that I would have to find another place to put them. My wife and I eventually found space 3 rows behind our seats. Sitting on the isle allowed me to be bumped in the shoulder by staff regularly throughout the trip. No acknowledgement or apologies received typified the standard of the service. We couldn't understand how the airline was 'award winning' based on experiencing both trips. I was able to get a laugh from the Etihad Airline's approach to censoring movies. (eg in The Monuments Men there were fuzzy spots strategically placed on famous works of art to protect the viewer's sensibilities!) If only they put the same care and attention into the service.,bad

Seat width was an excellent 18.5"" which greatly aided in comfort even though pitch was only 31"". I thought the equipment box under 8a was not overly intrusive and much better than on Continental's B737's. I found the seat width great the TV screen quality very good and the food good-enough.

First 10 hours to HK were okay pretty on par with other major airlines and no complaints about the A300 seat comfort access or configuration. However the A340 shell seats are hard uncomfortable and the worst I've sat on. The fact that the seat doesn't recline from your hips and merely slumps you downwards putting an immense amount of pressure on your lower back and bottom is terrible for getting any kind of sleep rest or even just general comfort. I'm average height and small build but I can only imagine with horror what this might feel like for taller or bigger built people. When slumped in the seat there then appears a large gap between the paper thin seat padding and the headrest causing further spinal issues with no support for your head neck and shoulders. As a final insult the seat belts have an airbag in them which makes one side of the belt extremely bulky quite weighty and cumbersome so that even just sitting upright never mind trying to sleep is uncomfortably restricted by this bulging leather strap. There's also limited leg room under the seat in front not sure why but it's probably the fault of the shell seat design being so low to the floor and there's also very limited space in the seat pocket annoying when you can't fit much under the seat either. The only saving grace this aircraft design has is the configuration. I was travelling with just one other person and it was nice to just sit in a twosome without fear of the dreaded middle seat or clambering over a stranger while they sleep to go to the restroom.,bad

The notion of paying premium price for two adults in three seats to be able to lay down is a joke. This would accommodate one adult at the most. This is being marketed for adults and families to lay down on long-haul flights. It is frustratingly cramped and the expectation set by the marketing makes it worse. The flight attendants have obviously dealt with this before as they started apologizing before we took off from LHR to LAX. We should have known something was wrong as the LHR ground staff wouldn't look us in the eye when we asked about the SkyCouch seating. Shame on Air New Zealand.,bad

Premium Economy seats have the controls for TV and audio built into the inside of the armrest so cannot be accessed if you are wedged into them. I was unfortunate enough to have a box under the seat in front so could not stretch out at all. My seat was far too narrow for me and I had to keep getting out of it during an 8 hr flight it made my journey horrendous. I upgraded on the return leg to upper class which cost an unacceptable amount but I felt that there was no option. It should be noted that the Premium Economy seating does not have moveable armrests and being fixed makes this worse. Economy seats do have some movement on the armrests but only to 3/4 posiiton.",bad

Even if the seat in front is in full recline position it does not crowd into your space much. The only drawback would be the less padding may cause more stress to your back on loner flights.

Seat bsase moves forward slightly and back rest moves with it to provide a minimum but not a comfortable amount. Lower part of seat doubles as a rest for upper legs (activated by button on seat). Base of seat in front has foot rest. However the seats are so close together than when the seat is in the reclined position and the leg rest raised it is impossible- even to rest feet on for rest as it is too close. I am of short stature and I was unable to sit comfortably for this reason. I found it necessary either to have my feet supported which led to fatigue in the upper legs or to have my upper legs supported meaning that my feet were ""dangling"". Sleep was possible but only just. Lights from other passengerе« seats and screens is very intrusive and impedes sleep. Everything is very close together giving no sense of privacy. The seat rows are so close that anyone sitting away from the aisle can only exit if the passenger on the aisle seat moves which is inconvenient for all. Unlike other reviewers I did not suffer any back pain or other serious discomfort but did not feel rested. The seat I had originally been assigned to was broken- the lower left rest disengaged and rose immediately I sat down - the latching mechanism was defective. This problem could not be sorted out before departure. However I was able to move to the next seat in the row. If this had not been the case then I suspect I would not have been allowed to use the seat during take off and landing since I could not sit in the ""upright"" position. Also the raised footrest would have impeded exit of the passenger sitting in the middle seat posing a safety hazard. The seats appeared to be superior to the economy seats as far as the width was concerned. However I do not consider the extra cost to be justified. The price differential compared to what is on offer is far higher than e.g. from economy to business.",bad

No mention was made to us when checking in that our seats had been switched for 4 centre seats one row from the back of the plane. When we complained we were told firstly it was a light flight and we had been moved to spread the load more evenly but would be able to move to vacant seats once plane had taken off. On the actual flight the captain advised that having received a number of complaints that the upper deck was not being used due to a broken lift. Whatever the reason we had a very uncomfortable flight siting so close to the toilets and subjected to both the toilet smells every time the door opened and people queuing to use the toilet all night. On top of this we were last to receive any food and by this time there was only turkey left and we had no choice of menu by the time service reached us. The final straw was being left with my uncollected breakfast tray despite twice having requested it's removal until a few minutes before we landed when it was finally taken of me. I will not be flying virgin again.,bad

There is a metal IFE box under each seat E making the leg room for the passengers in these seats virtually non-existent (especially when neighbouring seats are full). The plane was not entirely full and everyone was avoiding Es like a plague. In the end I managed to snatch an aisle seat (smaller IFE box but more leg room in the walkway). The FA refused to acknowledge that there is an IFE box in the legroom (was not complaining just informing her why I would like to change seats). If plane is close to capacity it is horrendous. Leg room is ridiculous. Seats tough and no padding. Personal space is zilch. On the plus side food was good and alcohol was freely available - but given the atrocity of seats take all the wine you can get.,bad

Staff are extremely professional and do not disturb you unlike other airlines we have flown. Although the food isn't great again it is better than a lot of airlines. In economy I can sleep for 6-8 hours undisturbed however my husband can get 3-4 hours. Pretty good considering. If you want to get upgraded EVA Air isn't the company to go with. In the years we have flown with them not once have we been lucky!,good

The seat diagram online showed a bulkhead wall in front of the seats but in reality there was no wall and the business seats had a tiny curtain from the top of the seats. We knew the arm rests wouldn't go up but we assumed there would be a wall of some type. So when the business seats reclined we had very limited leg room. The middle seat had no pocket because the view was straight down the whole business class section between the seats. We would have been better off in a regular seat which at least has arm rests that go up. I complained to Air Canada and all they offered was a 15% coupon for a future flight but with major restrictions. The reply from customer relations even stated that a discounted fare would be cheaper than applying the coupon to the full fare. This is the second time we received coupons we could not use as compensation. We will avoid Air Canada in the future.,neutral

The seats are thin enough to give good knee/leg room without compromising lumbar support. At least as comfy as the SQ econ seats. Seat feels solid and well built. New IFE uses a touchscreen - personally found it a bit slow rather temperamental. Have to wonder how these will hold up after several months of abuse by kids etc. Small recess under the IFE screen for storing phones cameras wallets glasses etc a nice touch. Thumbs up to CX for carving slits into this recess so you can easily see if you've left any valuables as you deplane.,bad

Seat too narrow seatbelt a real struggle to buckle pitch so short that I have to turn my legs in order to fit into the space allocated. Seat back would not stay upright kept sliding back. FA's seemed aware as they didn't ask me to bring my seatback up for takeoff or landing. The seat cover was ripped dirty and had several miscellaneous stickers ground into it. On the positive side I was able to track the flight so I always knew how much longer I had to endure.,bad

The seats had the same feeling as a ride in a taxi with that easy to clean material on the seat. The Recline was okay, there was no power outlet which really ticked me off on the A319, as my phone was dying. Legroom was mediocre and the width and aisle space was standard. My bag was forced to be Gate Checked on the 319 as there was in adequate storage onboard. I didnt have my Carry On Bag during my layover in Philly which was disappointing as I had a change of clothes incase it was humid ( which it very much was ).",bad

The seat had a pretty good legroom for a 737 type aircraft. The PTV had good options the food was also good. Only at KUL-LGK flight the same 737 they don't serve meal because it is a short 55 minutes flight but you do get small refreshments which is good enough to me. The PTV worked but no headsets and that was during KUL-LGK. But the PTV was locked during LGK-KUL. Will surely recommend this airline!,bad

Because of the block in the closing door you cannot stretch your legs and so you stay 11 hours with you thigh-knee-leg at right angles.

We had a really nice flight on Economy Plus - seats were comfortable with good legroom and good width (I'm 5""9), food was delicious and service was really good. Snacks and drinks available throughout the flight in the galley. Although there were not any personal TV's, a few movies were played on the overhead screens. We were seated in 21A and 21C, therefore we had a good view of the TV's. A flaw with United is the movies they show everyone on the overhead TV screens. I was shocked at amount of explicit sexual stuff in the movies, and adding onto that - theft, crime, violence, lots of kissing - in the movies they show. There were toddlers on the flight, and lots of children/teenagers that mostly were on a school trip. As a teenager, I was appalled by the entertainment shown to everyone - I believe that United should choose the movies that are shown carefully. Despite this, the rest of the flight was enjoyable.",good

The chairs were insufficiently upholstered narrow and the arms rests too were insufficiently upholstered and narrow. I was on an aisle seat and my elbow was repeatedly jogged by folks walking down the aisle. I got pins and needles fro being so cramped and I'm only 163cm. My daughter joked that the pillows were just Marimekko pillow slips they were flat and did little to offer any support If you choose Finnair be sure to take a travel pillow and ask for several pillows and blankets to try and prop your arms and provide lumbar support. I'm a pretty fit person and got up several times to stretch but I did myself nerve damage from being so cramped I worry how it would affect less robust people. I asked for a glass of water twice from stewards and was ignored my daughter asked not to be woken for meals after the first time she was woken for a meal and the stewards awoke her again. The chocolate wafers they had in the galley were I hung out helping myself to waters were pretty nice though.,good

In this row the armrests are immovable which is probably the only thing that kept the gentleman beside me from lying completely on me. The seats are narrow thinly padded and uncomfortable.

After a code share on an old Cathay Pacific plane I was looking forward to flying on one of the new A380s. I was quickly disappointed however. BA have decided to cram people in on this new plane. The legroom and general seat comfort was very poor. I only fly BA as I travel a lot with work and use BA for EU flights but I won't fly long haul with them again. It's disgraceful the tiny amount of room they give while continually saying ""enjoy your flight"". It is a matter of endurance not enjoyment.",good

Meals and drinks are served on China and glasses. The seats are most impressive I felt extremely comfortable in these seats and there was no sense that I was encroaching in my neighbors space. Legroom above average with plenty of space between myself and the seat in front of me - even when the seat in front was fully reclined. Seat pitch is far above the limited seat pitch in a conventional economy cabin. Tray tables are stowed in the left armrest and is fully flexible and adjustable to suit the 'shape' of the passenger and the meal service. PTV is stowed in the right armrest and can be used comfortably in conjunction with the tray table. IFE system is fast and responsive and had a good selection of shows and latest releases. A word of caution however is to check the aircraft operating your flight as the PTVs and IFE system was older on my return leg to JNB. Fewer options a more outdated UI and a disappointing experience. Almost all movies had Chinese and/or English subtitles - which for me was a deal breaker and resulted in me rather reading a book. This is a personal preference however but I would of appreciated an option to remove this! Overall a very good experience on QF premium economy - a great option for those wanting a true premium service at a fraction of business class prices!,good

On one leg of the flight there were empty seats next to me but I could not use them to recline because the armrests only fold up partially.

The seats were leather with generous leg room, seat pitch too was quite generous. The recline worked well and slid forwards as well as backwards - great sleep support though a tad more recline would've been great. I never usually manage more than 2-3 hours of constant shut eye on an airplane, but I managed to nod off for 6 hrs straight in this economy seat. Given the 3x3x3 config, the aisles were fairly large too.  If I had to crib, it would be the small'ish size of the TV screen, the lack of AC power (USB was available) and how tight the seat pocket flap was!",bad

The seats are not wide enough and there is no leg room (even for a short person). It was a seriously uncomfortable 12 hour flight enough for me to never want to fly Etihad again. Strangely enough the onward connecting flight to Islamabad had decent seats although that was also a B777 but apparently the aircraft belonged to a partner airline. Etihad is trying to milk as many passengers as they can using the high density 10 abreast with minimum seat pitch. Absolutely terrible experience.,bad

Firstly the seats, flying this airline you are going to get well acquainted with the person at the side of you. Most airlines we have flown use a 2x4x2 configuration which is ok, using a 3x3x3 means you are very cramped. We flew a different airline earlier in the day with the 2x4x2 in the same body and it was much more comfortable. I am 185 cm and I have broad shoulders and I was very uncomfortable for the transatlantic flight. The width of the isle was so narrow that I was not possible to pull my hand luggage along the floor. You will have to pay for a blanket and headphones on this airline. The in flight entertainment system is ok; full touch screen, but a limited number of movies and shows. The service was good, but it was obvious that the flight attendant was not fluent in French when making her announcements which for a dual language airline is not what you would expect. The attendants were friendly. Food was ok, but there was not enough. Flying this airline again I will make sure that I eat plenty before the flight! Overall I think it would be better to pay more for an airline with better service.",good

Viewing the screen is made difficult if the person in front reclines you have to recline to see the screen suitably.

The airline batted 100 percent in three categories: None of the flights were on time. All of the food was pretty bad (even for airplane food standards) and all the in-flight entertainment was outdated or physically unviewable. We did have one recent American film shown and it was great-- but it was a 1.5 hour flight so they cut it off before the ending. They are quick to warn you regarding turbulence and the flight attendants are plentiful and responsive. Best meal was the Chinese breakfast of yogurt fruit and pork and chicken dumplings. Drinks are frequently served  but beer/wine if at all available runs out quickly (but it is free in economy). No hard alcohol in economy.,good

My feet was rolled over twice by the food cart despite being kept within the boundaries of my seat area. No apology from the crew. Inflight entertainment breaks in between flight and during take off and landing, making it difficult to watch a show without being interrupted. Despite boarding on time, my luggage was shifted all the way behind by the staff (without asking/ seeking permission from me) when another passenger with a larger luggage came after me.",good

However Qantas are changing the configuration of the A380 and these seats will be come part of a multi row economy cabin on the upper deck. Getting in and out of these seats is a doddle. The recline is great. and the seat comfy. My only disappointment was that the leg rest didn't extend far enough. I guess that's because if there was a seat in front of me it would have been in the way! If I have the money I'd fly PE again but Qantas doesn't seem to offer it on my route once the Emirates tie in comes into effect,bad

My family travelled MAN-LIS-EWR-LIS-MAN in early April and the experience was excellent. A319/A320 on the MAN-LIS-MAN legs with lovely seats legroom hot meal and wine. A330 on the LIS -EWR- LIS legs. On the outbound we were on the oldest model in the fleet CS-TOH and on the return the youngest CS-TOP. The staff on all legs were very friendly the food on the New York legs was excellent (we had the fish on both legs) and their was plenty of beer and wine including sparkling wine. All legs were on time and we found Lisbon Airport a pleasure to transit through. The older A330 had a less advanced entertainment system but did have the nose cam which was great for take off and landing. The newer plane had the ;latest interactive touch screen system with lots of choice with both systems offering lots of English language selections. I would recommend and definitely use this airline again.,good

I used to fly Virgin very regularly between London and the US but haven't flown with them in the last 4 years and I have definitely noticed that the quality of the seating has deteroriated over that time. It almost feels like you are flying with a budget airline with the way Virgin have tried to cram every spare inch with a seat. I would be interested to know if they have changed the dimensions of the seats and the lefroom in the previous 4 years. The other minus point was the quality of the service The flight attendents could not have been more uninterested if they tried - it was very obvious that all they wanted to do was to feed the passengers and get to the back to chat with the other attendents. I would not fly Virgin again and based on this trip would not recommend them to anyone either.,bad

The legroom was generous (I am 194 cm and I could stretch out) and the space in front of the seat also made access very easy. However in a crowded plane the lack of shoulder room was very uncomfortable - this airline has nine seats across in its A330 cabin where most airlines have eight. The sense of tightness was exacerbated by the arm-rests on my row of seats having to accommodate tray tables narrowing the available space further. The seats themselves are leather clad and hard; they also lack lower lumbar support. They do have adjustable head rests - a great feature. I've rated the seat overall as a '5' simply because I managed to sleep for about two hours of a seven hour plus sector. I have rated the PTV screen as 1; in fact the on-board entertainment system comes in the form of portable units which can be rented - I didn't try them however.,bad

But upon check in (I meant both legs), we found out the selected seats were taken away from us and instead we were assigned random middle seats spreading through the aircraft. This means our child was forced to be seated with strangers. I immediately called and was told it was United's protocol to seat family together, especially those with children. Unfortunately the gate agent informed us, there was no seats available that she was unable to put us together. I need to make it very clear, there was no airplane or equipment change, at least none that I could detect, and the flight was on time. I thought this was an isolated incidence that we were so unlucky to have this occurred on us on both legs. But we met another family that was traveling on different route and dates, they had the similarly but worse experience. They printed the boarding passes the day ahead. Only found out they were assigned random middle seats during the curbside luggage check in. Their small child was forced to sit with strangers during an 8 hour flight.",bad

My seat was in the 20th row and there was very little ability for me to recline much. Unfortunately it was the redeye flight from Los Angeles to New York and I found it impossible to sleep. I knew not to expect much attention from the stewardesses in coach. On a positive note the small TV screens on the seat back in front were a fortunate surprise. However for the price of the ticket it would be nice if they supplied a little more room in coach.",bad

Row 35 has three off-center seats relative to the four seats of row 34. Between the brackets of the seat in front of you and boxes that hold life jackets there is no place to put your feet. There was a universal camaraderie in the cabin in suffering passengers of all shapes and sizes. People ignored the seat belt signs and milled about the cabin for periods of relief.

My friend and I managed to get joint seats on one side of the plane. Legroom was fine though the seats were kind of narrow and thinly padded. Our flight back on a Boeing 747-8, however, was a nightmare all thanks to the seats being even narrower, the legroom non-existent, no to mention these metal boxes attached to the floor right under the seat in front of you, which reduced your legroom even more. Initially I got bulkhead seat (18F) in the 4-seat row. If you think the regular seats are narrow, wait until you see the bulkhead ones. Because the armrests are fixed your legs are literally squeezed. I looked behind me and there was a vacant middle seat to which I moved right before take off. But that didn't do it either. I called the staff to ask for an upgrade to the Premium Class but it cost 399 euros. So my colleague, who had an aisle seat on the same row, was nice enough to trade places with me so I could have a little more room. But sleeping is out of question on such seats. I practically got no sleep at all, just like some passengers who'd rather stand up during the whole flight than being squeezed on a seat. Food was nice and so was the crew, but I vow never to flight coach on Lufhansa again.",bad

Glass of bubbly before takeoff with significantly better seats than Economy in terms of width and space in front. Even when the seat in front had fully reclined it did not bang into my knees and I could adjust the PTV angle to continue viewing. Aperitif meal with drink and a digestif made for a better service. Service was excellent with the benefit of having fewer passengers to serve. On the night flight returning we were on the last row before the partition and could fully recline for sleep.

The seat back was very thin even for an economy class seat so I felt every movement that the back passengers made and it was even worse because I had to travel with noisy children at my back so it was a constant kicking at my back. The plane had no IFE except for the overhead TV's and a couple of music channels - okay for a short haul flight but not for this kind of flight. Some seats did not have pillows blankets the airline magazine or even the safety chart. The only decent thing was the legroom so I could stretch my legs well to compensate the lack of seat recline. Copa is a good airline for short haul flights but I do not recommend anyone to fly it on longer flights.,bad

They are hard. The recline is very limited when it works and the fixed head rest is too low to support the head of anyone with any height. These problems were compounded by the failure to carry extension belts which fit the short seat-belts fitted on the second and third of the three rows (I was able to use the belt on the A319 on the connecting flight without difficulty). I therefore had to be transferred to the front row. This has a bulkhead which diminishes the value of the extra leg-room when the seat is upright: when I tried to use the (limited) recline  an extension came out which pinned my feet to the bulkhead. In short this cabin is over-priced offering less than the preferred seats in the Air Canada Economy cabin",good

The entertainment system was excellent. Getting from the window seat to the aisle required the other 2 passengers to move from their seats to be stuck in this situation for 12 hours is inhuman the plane was fully occupied. In future I will become more selective in choosing the carrier who provides the best seat pitch on long haul flights.,good

Added to the awful seat pitch was the fact that the armrests which usually recede completely into the seat backs no longer do so. So although the flight was only half full it was impossible to utilise the spare seats next to me. On a 13.5 hr flight from SFO to AKL this becomes very important. Food and service okay but if the seats are diabolical then everything else pales into insignificance.,bad

But due to the fold-in ptv in the armrest the console for the handset is located on the side of the armrest taking almost 5 centimeters of the seat width. The console also had hard edges that made very painful to sit in the chair during takeoff and landing. I spent a 10 hour flight sitting on the edge of the seat and standing in the aisle. Tried to change the seat but it was not possible because the flight was fully booked. This flight was a total disaster and looking for another airlines for future bookings. Look carefully at your seat assignment and beware of the exit row seats on the 747s that have the refurbished cabins with PTVs. These seats are not suitable even for normally built persons!,good

No individual screens just a select few throughout the cabin. Our seats were changed at the last minute due to operational needs ie. should have been a B777 but was a B767-300 instead. We paid for preferred seats with no one behind us but got stuck with people in front and behind due to change. I would not fly American Airlines again unless I was desperate. The crew were miserable and ready for retirement. We barely saw them too busy at the back of the plane reading and chatting! American Airlines need to get their act together. The outbound flight from LHR-DFW (B777 27A/B) wasn't much better and was treated like a night flight even though it was 9.30am! The 'fasten seatbelt' sign was illuminated the whole ten hours even though there was no turbulence to stop passengers getting out of their seats. Food really poor and tasteless. Go for another airline if you can!,bad

I could not tuck my leg under it without feeling a lot of compression on it. My shoulders had to be curled forward like a racecar as I could not flatten my shoulders completely. To exit the seat row I had to bend at a 45 degree angle. The cabin and seat was clearly ageing. The seat base was saggy and as the pocket was saggy it used up even more of the limited space.

What we experienced was cramped seats touching my knees when the passenger in front reclines tired rude staff my audio jack in my seat was broken so I could not watch a film. Overheated dried out food. We were seated upstairs towards the front on P Economy with 40+ economy seats behind full of loud unruly children and parents. The crew were also handing out free champagne to the upstairs economy even though they had not paid for this service. I feel that Thomson Airways new B787 Premium Economy is leaps ahead in quality/cost and comfort compared to Virgin Atlantic and I have already booked my return flights with Thomson in August 2015 to return to the US.,good

The seats were very comfy and reclined far enough to sleep. The legroom was very good as I am quite short. The entertainment is the best I have experienced, a good range of movies etc. The only downside was before every movie there were about 2 minutes of ads (although you can skip through them). Another downside was that there weren't many toilets on this plane as there are none at the back of the aircraft. Cathay's food was very nice and their service was very good as well. ",bad

ZERO leg room. Fine if you are a child but not for adults. No easy access to water. You have to get up and ask or occasionally crew come around with some outside of meal times. Never again Etihad.

Once on the plane, we found that our boarding passes led us to the center four seats with no extra legroom. This occurred on both of the roundtrip segments. When I complained at the time of seating, I was told that the plane was full and the only extra leg space would have been the exit row, which we (understandably) were not eligible to sit it with disabilities. When we returned home, the person on the phone rudely told me that no extra leg room seats were available - and when I explained that I had an extra receipt showing that I had indeed paid the price - she replied that I would be refunded the money..

My complaint is about the new economy seats with the TV screens. For starters there are three 10""x12""x4"" metal boxes (possibly to run the TV's?) attached to the pedestals. They dramatically reduce the space for ""personal items"" and therefore increase the pressure on the precious overhead bins. In a world where the power of a 1980's IBM 360 can practically be delivered in a smartphone it is ""inelegant"" at best and embarrassing at worst that these huge clunky boxes are the ""solution"" for the new seats. Also the ""back pocket"" is now just (1) a hard plastic sleeve filled with AA magazines and (2) a net pocket below that is so small and pulls out not--at-all leaving room for a couple of business cards.",bad

The services provided by the crew was pleasant the PTV was nice but what is bothering me the most are the seat width and access in/out of the seat. The seat width was really narrow and basically you would make contact with the passenger beside you all the time. And accessing in/out of the seat will disturb the passenger beside you which probably both of you will need to stand up for you to access out/in. The aisles are also narrow due to the 3x4x3 configuration. I really dislike this configuration.,good

With the introduction of the A380 I expected Qantas to improve seating in both cabins. Unfortunately not. The Premium Economy seat is OK but why would Qantas decide it should be at the back of the upper deck? There is very limited overhead storage especially for people with full size roll on bags. Being at the back on the plane there is far more lateral movement and it is very noticeable so in comparison to the 747 Premium economy I found myself less comfortable due to the bumping around had to shunt by carry on luggage in a different location to where I was and we were one of the later ones off the plane meaning a longer wait in the dreaded passport control. The food was pretty ordinary as well. I can never understand that these flights are always full yet Qantas bleats about struggling to make ends meet and keeps dropping the quality of services.,good

You feel cramped with little legroom and the backrest has a hard area that sticks out and makes it difficult to lean properly back. The recline is ok but as long as you have someone behind you, reclining is not an option. The fact that my traytable was very loose of course did not help. in my 40 years of intercontinental travel, I' ve experienced worse seats but that was a long time ago.",bad

Seat pad moved forward slightly which brought my knees up against the seat in front Because of design of seat there was no head support and pillow supplied didn't fill the gap between back of my head and seat. The airbag attached to the seatbelt caused problems when the passenger in the adjoining seat moved they pushed down on the armrest which forced the airbag down into my thigh. The armrests were about 5cms too low and as a result didn't offer any support.,good

A380 is not perfect but sitting anywhere for 14 hours isn't going to be a great experience. The best seats are at the back of A380 ideally the row ahead of the crew sleeping section as they can be reclined without inconveniencing those behind you close proximity to the single rear toilet - if you're bored the crew often congregate at the rear and up for a chat.,good

I have a bad back and the result was agony and crippling. The return flight was so painful I thought I was going to pass out and that was after 2 hours! There was no room to stretch and the seat provided so little wriggle room. I tried exercises and everything to make myself comfortable. The cabin staff were wonderful and the food was great.

I was travelling with my wife and we were fortunate enough to have a row of 3 seats to ourselves on both legs of the flight. While this allowed us a deal more comfort I have not factored this into this review. My score is based on the overall comfort of a single seat. The A380 is a very comfortable and quiet aircraft service of cabin staff was exceptional food was good however the entertainment selection onboard was perhaps not as varied as I had expected.,good

The seat looks very good on the website as well as when first looking at it for real. Air France makes its Premium Economy a real additional class. There are fewer seats per row (2x3x2 as opposed to 2x4x2) and the Video Screen is much larger. There are better headphones than in Economy and the seat is designed so that you have real isolated private space. You also have quite a lot legroom. Unfortunately the design of the seat itself is an outright disaster. The seat area itself is way too short even for normal sized people. The seat does hardly recline at all. The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be very small. However not using the footrest will have your feat dangling in mid air. There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is to short it will hardly support anything. The whole seat design feels strangely like a business class seat for small children. Because of the legroom the good entertainment system and the private space this seat is probably an option for a day flight where seating comfort does not matter much. For an overnight long haul it is just a disaster.,good

The only few things I could complain about was the fact that I had to use vile urine smelling lavatories that looked like they had been vandalised. And also the useless uninspiring staff that all looked like they had swallowed a wasp. Four hours into the flight they had got bored and were all playing scrabble on their iPhones at the back of the plane and you had to go and ask them for a drink and even then they gave you the evils and threw it at you. Can't beat a good douse of British hospitality!,bad

With the seat in front of me fully reclined I could not exit my seat without lifting myself off the seat with my arms and levering my legs sideways. Re- entering the seat required major acrobatics as well. Legroom was insufficient and recline minimal. The seating was so bad that it really should not be allowed and I actually hold the airline licensing and accreditation bodies responsible for allowing this to happen. In flight entertainment was terrible since there are only old colour fringed CRT monitors on the ceiling. Headphone jacks are also incompatible with 3.5mm adapters preventing the use of normal headphones. Food was good however especially kids' meals.,bad

A two hour flight is just tolerable anything more is torture. Even trying to drink a cup of coffee involves a level of physical dexterity that would have defeated Houdini. Removing four or five rows of seats and realigning the seats would give everybody a much more comfortable flight. I suppose money talks and if there weren't seat pitch regulations they would be squeezing in another five rows.,bad

Family member was sitting in 80B and for economy seat this was pretty standard compared to other airlines besides for the fact there is a net to place you feet in under the seat in front. This makes it feel you have more leg room and is pretty comfortable. When seats recline the whole seat moves with you including the bottom part so this makes the seat seem to recline a bit more.,good

It is an improvement on coach in terms of legroom and seat comfort the cabin service is more personal and although the food and drink is the same it is served with cloth serviettes and steel cutlery. (How do they get steel knives through security?) The main benefit though is that there were lots of empty seats while coach on this flight from CPT to LHR was full. The biggest let-down is the tiny low-res TV screen. One factor in favour of coach is that the hand-rests fold back so that if you're lucky enough to be the sole passenger in a row of 3 or 4 you can lie across the seats and enjoy a business class standard lie-flat bed. The World Traveler plus armrests are fixed.,good

Took 2 flights from Muscat to Heathrow (transit in Doha) and I was still feel as fresh as ever when landed in T3. The seat is big enough for me and the leg room still has some space (I'm 5'8 btw). The food and cabin crew were superb.,good
7768,7753,425.940600872901,2017-01-12,-68.042378,-118.037322,699,Far from ideal economy seats for a long haul flight - you book Virgin with the expectation of getting something a little better but this is definitely not true anymore with economy. Very modest incline on the seat certainly no where close to feeling like a natural sleeping position. Just about enough leg room for me as a 5'8 tall man but in some seats the seat mounting will stop you being able to stretch out. Food was average - standard meal tray with a cold starter (pasta salad) rubbery bread roll and a small hot element (either lasagna or chicken) which reminded me of a cheap ready meal. Second meal was a cold snack consisting of a very small sandwich and a very small packet of premium crisps. Other than that got one hot and one cold drink service with and just after the main meal. Our plane had being recently refitted so the new touch screen entertainment system was in place and I have to say this was excellent with a very good selection of recent films and TV. Very small screen but this didn't matter so much in economy as you are never too far away from the seat in front! Other than that the cabin in the 747 was starting to show its age which I guess was not surprising considering it has being flying since 2001. I would not go out of my way to book Virgin again.,good

Left leg sort of lost feeling, right leg could stretch out, and that was the constant struggle I had to deal with. If the front passenger fully reclines, there goes the space which you thought you had. The seat is pretty much over the tray tables, watching a movie whilst eating was a delicate balancing act. Overall, decent but there are better airlines for long haul flights.",good

But on the return flight the seats were non reclinable (shell seat) and a 12 hours night flight in one of these is pure torture. Never had I ever travelled in such seats and never will I ever reiterate this experience. Ergonomics is absolutely not considered and despite of my small size which make most of my long distance flight seems pretty confortable in comparison to taller people these seats kept me from sleeping and my back still hasn't recover two days later. Only positive aspects of my flights were the helpful staff nice food and good entertainment.,bad

Is it really acceptable that as soon as you get on a flight you fully recline your seat for the whole journey straight into the face of the traveller behind. Cabin crew do nothing can't see the screen struggling to eat struggle to get out to use the bathroom. This happens every time. Enough either ban the recliner or make them pay more for the space they use up.,bad

This seat has a metallic box on the floor in the foot space and you cannot put both foot together in this space so I had one feet in the space and the other laying on the aisle for 12 hours.,good

If no one else pays for and reserves an exit row seat you may be th eonly person sitting in the exit row even if the rest of the aircraft is packed. Exit row seats are not assigned to regular passengers. The leg room is great which compensates from the fact that none of the seats on Ryanair recline which is a good thing in that you never have the seat in front of you pressed against your face or run the risk of a passenger in front pushing back their seat while you are eating a meal or when you have a drink on the drop-down tray and it ends up on your lap. The thing you need to do with Ryanair is to know and follow the rules. ,bad

I have since had seats 18B and 18G with nothing in front of me but a wall to Executive first. The seats are narrower and don't have moveable arm rest thanks to the try being in them. Check in online early to get the best seats you can is my advice.,bad

I have travelled in both an inside and outside seat on the right and left of the two aisles and not the odd-looking away-facing pairs in the centre so my comments apply to the former. You sit at an angle of about 20 degrees to the aisle with the backs of the seat shells in front of you at the normal (right angle) to the aisle. This means that your TV (which can just about compensate for the off-centreness) and your tray table (which can't) are at a weird angle. The window seats have better leg room than the aisle ones but the down side is that getting out - particularly if the 'aisle' person has the TV out on its angled stilts and the tray table open (no rim glassholder or recess- beware!) is a mountaineering job - but at least using the shell in front as a lever will not disturb the occupants Air New zealand are obviously sensitive about it as on both flights the concierge were on the defensive (unsolicited on my last flight) - ""We've taken one row of seats out"" (Heaven knows what it was like before). But despite them being a bit hard one can get quite comfortable. Lovely big pillows and a 'bean bag' for you feet. Just be prepared to eat off centre.",good

Before the aircraft took off the FA walked down the aisle with wet towels which was pleasant. After the seat belt signs were off the FA came around for drinks - water beer or orange juice. I was trying out their new WIFI inflight entertainment and encountered some problems but the FA was very helpful and helped troubleshoot the problem and I got my entertainment on my phone! They also played shows on the overhead screens (without sounds though). Food was good. After meals the FA came around with coffee/tea and another round of drinks before landing. Although the flight was slightly delayed it was a pleasant journey and I would fly with them again.,good

I have flown this class with other providers without concern but the ""spaceseat"" is the most uncomfortable and worst ergonomic design My wife and I have ever experienced. There is no foot rest very poor reclining and tilt options and poor head rest design. The spaceseat provides NO place to put things (except my glasses case) any drink bottle book etc had to go on the floor or in the overhead locker. The diagonal configuration creates a number of problems you need to twist at an odd angle to watch your video screen or if you extend it out on the arm it ends up very close to your face and prevents you leaving the seat without disturbing the person next to you. The video remote is located in the seat by your elbow as a result is very easy to activate the functions when attempting to sleep (no chance too uncomfortable) I managed to turn on my screen and overhead lights and call the flight attendant all when trying to sleep. If you own a motor bike and lock it up with a huge chain you will appreciate the seat belt design . Air NZ staff were very good as was the food and wine. But the seats  I felt I had spend 12 hours on the rack in some castle dungeon. You have been warned go economy and buy 3 seats between two.",bad

The seats are a bit narrower than other airlines but not noticeable to me. And I'm 5'11"" 185 lbs. When reclining the bottom portion slides forward a bit; again makes no difference to me. The real stickler is that the seat tracks will end up between your feet. Really annoying if there are carry-ons stuffed down there. Why do I rate high? These are the only seats I can sit in for 10+ hours and my ass not get sore or fall asleep. No need for awkward shuffling around to get some circulation going. Maybe it's the padding maybe it's because the equipment is new or maybe because Recaro really knows how to make seats. Either way I like them. Not included in the rating is the service: Outstanding. Not the standard drink meal drink meal service. They offer lots of drinks. And when it's nap time aboard and the lights dimmed a little counter by the galley is constantly re-stocked with snacks and refreshments (including beer I think Lufthansa really wants people to drink beer). Snacks include pretzels and Toblerone chocolate.",bad

I found that the A380 was an uncomfortable flight as when the person in front reclines you are left hardly any leg room also found that the trays were smaller the toilets smaller. I would never fly with Qantas again as I found the ground staff rude and unhelpful when we complained that they had not put our party of 4 together they had even placed the two teenage girls in our party next to a young man which the ground staff explained that they could not make any seating changes we were lucky the flight crew were able to arrange other seating arrangements.,bad

I will definitely upgrade from now on if the price is reasonable. I was fortunate to have the aisle seat on the 4 seat center row and the seat beside me was empty! There was so much more leg room that I was comfortably able to stretch me bad knee out. The seat felt a bit wider too. I believe the food was the same that's served in Economy which on BA is pretty tasty. The only difference was that they came around with a basket of warm rolls tastier than the freezing cold ones you usually get. At the beginning of the flight they gave out warm damp hand towels very refreshing. Only problem was the couple in front of me reclined their seats all the way back the minute that they sat down. The person's head was basically in my lap. Unbelievable rude. I had to ask the flight attendant to request that they raise their seat during meal service or I wouldn't have been able to eat. I wish the airlines wouldn't have seats that recline into the lap of the passenger behind them a little recline is okay but too far just doesn't work.,bad

Blue leather type seat and just by looking at the seat you can tell it was going to be hard and offer little comfort. Touchscreen TV in the rear of the seat in front which is fine, when it works. The screen has no tilt function so reclined viewing is an issue. Leg room is ok for someone who is 5ft 8"". I wouldnt like to try it being anything over 6ft. The seat is ok for the first couple of hours but becomes very uncomfortable and is difficult to get any sleep in. Seat reclines however sometimes springs back up without warning. I would compare the comfort to that of Easyjet. Fine for an hour or two but not for longhaul. Gulf Air A320 seat is far far more comfortable.",good

The product on the 777 is far inferior and not worth the extra fare - the seat was cramped the same width as the economy seats whereas the 747 premium economy seats are somewhat wider. Air New Zealand should have configured the 777 premium cabin as 2-3-2 or even 2-3-3. The 17.8 inch width of this premium economy seat is 0.7 inches narrower than Air Canada's standard economy seat on the same aircraft type.,good

I'm not exactly skinny but neither am I obese yet this seat was so narrow it cut off circulation to my thighs. To make matters worse my shoulders and upper arms kept bumping up against the passenger to my right (I was in an aisle seat) to the point where I finally had to get up and pace around the plane to relieve the discomfort. Throughout the entire trip from Miami to Paris I was lucky if I was able to sleep for 20 minutes. I arrived at my destination in the Middle East feeling like I'd been run over by a truck.,bad

With no seat behind you can put the seat back at any time without worrying about others behind you. The bulkhead section nearby houses a galley (no toilets) and while there is some noise it tends only to be noticeable at meal service times. As the last 2 rows are only 2-abreast there is only one person to get past when getting out of your seat (I tend to prefer a window on longhaul as I have a broad upper body and so always tend to get bumped into by passersby on the aisle).,good

But this time I was excited to try the brand new 747-8 thinking it would be more spacious and comfortable than the old 400s. My mistake. The truth is they shrank the space in the coach class and created a more spacious Business and First Class. More than half of the 747's main deck is dedicated to First and Business while 262 coach passengers are squeezed on the rear. I am 1.80m tall and it was very difficult to me to find a nice position to rest and relax. Absolutely no sleeping during the 11 hours flight! To make it even worse the flight was completely full. The good things? The staff was nice and friendly the food was good and there was plenty of drinks you don't use to find in someone's else coach class. On the first flight's leg (CDG-FRA) I travelled on a LH A321 which was much more comfortable and spacious than the long haul 747. This is happening not only on Lufthansa but in several other airlines I have flown lately like United Airlines TAM Airlines Delta etc. Lufthansa again? Only if I get a business or first class ticket.,good

The longer leg to Perth was in a A330-200 and the difference was significant in that it was cramped and the seat was as hard as a park bench. Crew were excellent and professional. The IFE was good bar the endless repetitions of an advert for property in UAE at the beginning of each programme - wearing when you are binge watching! The food was fine and plentiful - no complaints about drinks service. Abu Dhabi airport is ok - like a small provincial shopping mall with planes parked outside. We managed to bag some floor space and crash out for a couple of hours. I thought Etihad were one of the best airlines we've been on (especially given the rock bottom prices) but the experience highlighted again the vast difference between the A380 and older smaller aircraft. If you can find someone who goes the whole way A380 then pick them and hopefully more airlines will buy them.,good

When seat in front is suddenly reclined you can get scalded if you have a hot drink on your table. Seats terribly narrow and obstructions in the way of your feet as well. Entertainment system is poor. All the music is American and the film choice is terrible. Difficult to get in and out of seat if not in an aisle seat. Will not be doing this length of journey again unless I can get a reasonably priced upgrade.,bad

Reported to BA on arrival. Return to LGW 2 weeks later same run down aircraft seat not fixed and in addition my wife's was broken as well this time. Reported to crew again and an engineer did a temporary fix before take-off. It soon broke again! Didn't have dinner it was 1am but breakfast was the worst I have been presented with in over 40 years of frequent flying a grey/green omelette and undercooked sausage - I did not eat it. It was an old WT+ cabin and even if they had been properly working the seats are not good. Food same as Economy drinks from plastic and paper cups. It really is a very poor product and `BA should be ashamed of it. I would not travel with BA long haul in this cabin ever again as it offers poor value for money and great discomfort. Save up to go Club if at all possible or choose another airline on the same route whose Premium Economy lives up to what it claims.,bad

Rather we had a CRT every 10 rows (and ours was broken). This means that the Seat arms go up all the way and no boxes to block legroom. The bad - well seat back IFE is essentially ""the standard"" now. So I am of two minds. The leg room and fully disappearing arm rests are good. The old cushionless cushions very bad. The lack of seat back IFE that's just unusual and very third world. So if you are taking a night flight the plane is not full and you don't need to be entertained this is likely better than most of the coach across the Atlantic.",bad

The seat has good pitch very good width and storage with the cubbin on the seatback plus three pouches below the literature pocket- all very useful for a long flight. The AVOD system is great but only needs more and better choices of programs and games. Two major problems with these new seats - the base seat cushion becomes hard quickly and the recline intrudes greatly on personal space and privacy. At two hours (on a 15 hour flight) the seat became noticeably uncomfortable. My legs became numb from pinched circulation at about 3 hours. The new 6 inches recline is nice when you are sitting in it but intrudes greatly into the space behind you. The unpredictability of a 2 to 6 inch recline creates stress. Your knees get banged laptop knocked off the tray table etc. And your personal space and privacy is mostly in control of the whim of the passenger in front of you. Also the thinner and lighter seat material makes for a smaller seat footprint which amplifies the loss of privacy when the person in front or to your side reclines. When the adjacent seat reclines if you are to the right you get an almost full view of their TV screen. That can be a distraction to you as their screen flashes when you want to read or sleep.",good

I was lucky to sit at the emergency exit so legroom was not a problem. In the normal rows I can barely squeeze in (I tried). Also the seat is barely wide enough to sit in. Consequently there is not enough space for the upper body. I had physical contact with my neighbour the whole time. The seat is also quite hard. The only good thing I can say is the head rest. You can adapt it to keep your head from rolling to the side so you will not need a neck pillow.,bad

It is probably 15"" when you account for the IFE controller digging into your thigh the entire flight. Flew to the US in this same seat arrangement a few years back and it was equally miserable. Unless you are a typical Japanese size (small) this seat is horribly narrow. Don't know about legroom in the normal seats but it must be equally as bad.",good

PE is just that premium and I will never fly regular economy again. 28D isle on the LAX-MEL leg last row in PE. I am 6'1 and had more than ample leg room to really stretch out. Seat recline accompanied that I could stretch out entirely amazing and I slept 7hrs. Real dishes glass's cutlery even a tray table cloth. Pre-flight Drink wine amenities bag excellent flight crew - atentive. Flight back 26K window. Even better with the additional side storage at the window. ONLY two issues - one in a Window seat hard to get out if like me flying solo. Had to ask my row mate to get up. This was only when the seat in front was reclined. Two - seat could have had a little more padding. Otherwise outstanding product and if you can afford it I more than recomend.,good

I had just enough legroom so my knees did not bang into the seat in front of me and I was able to cross my legs no problem. There is definitely less legroom between the Rouge Business seats compared to the Air Canada Business seats. The seats are pitiful on the recline only 3 inches and is pretty useless. The seats on Rouge are called ""New Slimline Seats"" and they definitely are slimline especially on the cushion aspect as well as much narrower since they have jammed 3 seats across into the same space that used to have 2 across. There is absolutely no lumbar support so lower backpain is the reward after a couple of hours. 2 other aspects about the seats the actual length front to back of the seat is less than normal so no support for the upper thighs which can be problematic for some. No inflight TV screen on the seatbacks just the foldaway meal table a-la 1970s aircraft seats along with a couple of pockets.",good

When passengers in front reclined there was little room for my head and it was nearly impossible to get up and out. If I had to fly with Monarch again I'd definitely pay for extra legroom.,bad

However the new B787 (DOH-BRU return) horrible. Main problem is the entertainment system box which intrudes into legroom for A C D F G and K seat. It occupies about one third of the space directly in front of the seat. On one sector the middle seat was empty so sitting on an angle made it almost tolerable but on the return the middle seat was occupied and I had to squeeze my foot between the seat support and the curved sidewall. Other Qatar flights maybe but if it involves a connection in DOH to a 787 forget it.,good

However this was the most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. I am 6' tall. I had absolutely no legroom with my knees pressing into the seat in front. This became even more uncomfortable once the passenger in front reclined their seat. I could not move my legs due the large entertainment system metal box on the floor immediately in front of where my right foot should rest forcing me to shift my foot far to the right. It was almost impossible to get up from my seat and get to the aisle with the seats in front reclined. I could not open my laptop on the table. I am a medical doctor. This cramped uncomfortable posture and difficulty in getting up to walk must considerably increase my risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. This was more cramped than any budget airline I have been on. Having been a loyal BA customer for decades I will now never fly with BA again. Really disappointing.,good

We had chosen seats 52J and 52K bulkhead seats in the first row of the second economy class cabin which did offer more leg room. They are located next to the galley so you get a lot of noise from that area. This did not bother me at all but on a much longer flight if you wanted to sleep may have been a bad choice. The hot towels were very welcome and also the drink service was efficient. When the evening meal was served we seemed to wait ages for the cart to appear at our row. We were offered the choice offered on the menu of Beef or Salmon and then immediately told the Salmon had run out some time ago. Then why offer it? Our row was not offered tea or coffee during the meal service. Just prior to landing the female flight attendant decided to tidy her hair and apply make-up in the galley mirror which took some time she should have done this out of sight of passengers. I think Singapore and Thai in my opinion offer much more for economy passengers.,bad

That being said I'm not sure who designed the seats in Moana Economy Class but I have no idea what they were thinking with the headrest. The seats are as expected in economy class - not much leg room narrow worn and used seats. I'm your average 5'5 female and felt the space was adequate enough although man spreaders definitely make the space more cramped. My biggest gripe is the headrest which can move up or down but for the most part feels like someone is shoving your head forward into the most uncomfortable position in the world. There's just no way to get comfortable. For an 8 hour flight from LAX it makes sleeping difficult even if the seat is all the way reclined. The best you can do is sleep with your head tilted forward and arms crossed over your chest. Most positive comment would be the IFE which had a number of on demand movies/shows which was easy to use. Nice big crisp touch screen. Food wasn't the greatest but they feed you twice on each leg of the trip. FA's friendly enough; French and English.,bad

I chose EVA Air premium economy because I wanted that little bit extra legroom and width of seat for a non stop 11 hours flight. I found the flight both comfortable and relaxing. I was able to fall asleep for at least 5 on both legs and the TV in-flight service was excellent. The only annoying part of the flight was the fact that the in-flight box is situated in the seat underneath in front and therefore prohibits foot movement to a certain extent. The meals were good and fresh. I paid around МвGBP900 return for the experience which was great value. Eva are a good airline and the attendants are very pleasant and cheerful. However the flight outward was 2 hours late departing from LHR so some transfers to other flights in BKK were missed.,good

However this trip was by some margin the worst I have experienced on long haul. I fear BA's hype about investment in premium economy seats is ill founded and after some 24 hours in the same seat broken by stop for refuel in Singapore I came into Heathrow sore from the seat. The service was satisfactory and when I became ill on one leg of the flight staff couldn't have been more helpful. But the seat discomfort was such that I would only choose BA for long haul as a last resort.,bad

When eventually the meal reached Row 76 it was luke warm. The drinks trolley arrived as we were finishing the meal and tea and coffee was not offered. Landing at DXB was delayed for over one hour by a duststorm that we understood had been raging for several days. We boarded the B777 for DXB-DAR on time only to sit on the stand for some two hours whilst other flights were given greater priority to take off in the limited visibility caused by the duststorm. To be fair the flight and service on this leg was quite reasonable once airborne. However we arrived at DAR so late that we had missed our onward flight to ZNZ and had to pay for a replacement and to add to the stress Emirates had opted to leave one of our bags either at LHR or DXB. The return from DAR-DBX was good but the having boarded the A380 at DBX very efficiently the departure from the stand on the DXB-LHR was delayed for an hour due to a medical emergency (obviously not Emirates fault). Once airborne it was again evident that the cabin crew simply cannot cope with the number of passengers a fully loaded A380 and once again service did not match expectations. From past experience Emirates has always warranted its 4 star rating but standards have clearly slipped in recent time and that is no longer the case. We will need to find an alternative airline for our next trip to DAR/ZNZ,good

The in-flight entertainment had many recent films of different genres to choose from good amount of seat width and a good seat recline. The food served in my opinion was fantastic with usually an asian option or western dish. The bigger windows on the 787 were amazing you get a fantastic view whilst not compromising the view of the other passengers.,good

They are much better compared to many other airlines in Europe (Lufthansa SAS Air France) and simply superior in comparison to United's domestic fleet. The seats are thin leather seats with a reasonable recline the only real negative point is the lack of larger armrests. Hopefully they will go back to the classic large seats they used to have that still provided much comfort in a 3x3 configuration. *Note: no PTV enjoy the view of the Alps!,good

Positives - Window seat has a large locker between the window and the seat meaning that I did not have to get up at all through the flight for laptop/book/iPod/etc. Seats A and C share a 110/240 volt power socket meaning I could watch video on my laptop the whole trip and resting the laptop on the lid of locker meant the laptop could still be open while I ate the meal. Negative - I ended up with very sore shins as when I slept I slid forward and my shins were resting up against the 'footrest'. I tried using the footrest but found it too high to be comfortable - probably a little better for those under 6 foot.,bad

The return flight was direct with a 2 hour changeover in Hong Kong. I can only agree with the majority of passengers on this site who have already reviewed the new seats. They are actually appalling - the worst I have ever experienced. They do not recline and for myself and my husband that made sleep impossible. Whenever we tried to fall asleep our heads would loll forward the breathing became restricted and we immediately woke up. The slide forward motion of the horizontal seat only succeeded in creating a non-supported gap behind the lower back which was very uncomfortable.,good

Tried to sleep but couldn't and on both flights ended up with sore butt and neck/head ache as well. Just weak. Have two more flights with these seats both overnight and are dreading them both. Will not ever fly economy with CX again with these seats and I will not ever fly economy to London again as I barely survived the Economy crush.",good

Many of the passengers arriving late for check in were allowed to get on the only other flight. Those if us who were earlybirds were denied that option. The last of 4 flight delays was due to a late crew member. Unacceptable! 10 hour delay. Employee could not answer any questions from dissapointed customers and contradicted Sunwing policy on their website as far as reimbursed expenses for hotel etc. Contradictory info was provided at the 7 hour delay mark. Policy says no hotel provided but employee said just submit a receipt. Didn't trust her on that one. Her supervisor eventually attended to deal with complaints and was not helpful at all.  Will not fly with Sunwing Airlines again. They provided photocopied $75.00 vouchers for future flight which will be used for lighting our fireplace this winter.,good

The back of the seat provides no lumbar support and is hard. I will happily put up with this given the huge improvement brought about by the seat sliding forward into a recline rather than by tipping the seat back into the lap of the guy behind. This must lower passenger tension and air-rage and is surely worth it. I will no longer have to fight for an exit row or bulkhead seat again.",good

There were many Indian nationals onboard which resulted with many special meals (vegetarians etc.) However many of them ""preferred"" to switch seats which made meal service very frustrating for the crews plus it was a full load flight. I don't blame them. I sat on the left aisle towards the back of the plane. Recline was minimal but that didn't stop me from sleeping. It was an overnight flight from Kuala Lumpur to Auckland. There were no flight map indication on the IFEs so I had no idea where we were flying throughout the entire flight. Food was not worth talking about I don't really care for it. I'm thankful I had a considerate neighbour next to me who scooched towards the window while he sleeps leaving me a little bit more space. Legroom wise it was ok. I'm 1.85m tall and my legs fit snugly in the seat. However there's more than enough space when I straighten my legs underneath the seat. Pretty much slept the entire journey. The plane was looking real tired. Really no qualms about it other than the rest of the passengers who are rude and taking the crews for granted. So if you're flying with MH have little to no expectations whatsoever they have will surprise you if any. I just booked a flight from Singapore - Kuala Lumpur - Sydney (return) for December. This time it'll be on their Airbus planes. We'll see.",bad

The seat is wide, roomy, and exceptionally comfortable in all modes except for full flat position (solution - make it a little less flat and it is much more comfy!). Service was excellent with the friendly crew showing a flair often absent these days. Food is the same as available for economy. A unique product for a LCC, which I will be using again.

I think it was even narrower than the seats on Ryanair which is a budget airline. Legs were pressed right into back of the seat in front and when they reclined it was game over. Never again. It is strange as I use Air France on European flights as well and the seats on the smaller aircraft are wider and with more legroom!,good

These seats are in the exit row so leg room is not an issue nor is the narrowness of the seats. I've heard complaints about the temperature but that wasn't a problem with the blankets provided. There really isn't much of a window for this row. The side storage bin is a little awkward to reach and can disturb the passenger behind you when accessing. Our return flight LHR to LAX ‰ЫТ 747-400 ‰ЫТ we had seats H and K in row 25. We found these seats to be extremely comfortable especially with no one behind us. Having the lavatory close by was not an issue most folks passing by were quiet.,bad

Seats in front recline brings the person in front into your face and body unless you recline your seat too - and I'm not a big person! Service etc. was excellent but poor seating provision makes this a no-go for long haul flights. Some economy seats had retractable armrests but most had minimal retraction - row 46 none! Passengers should be advised on seat maps - we booked months in advance and had the worst seats on the flight thanks to a check in clerk who moved us to supposedly 'better seats'. We travel this route regularly and will try to avoid Air New Zealand if they don't wake up and do better in future.,bad

The new seat doesn't give a good sleeping position but few economy seats do. My big gripe is the cushion thickness. While just about bearable on the LHR-HKG leg it became very painful on the HKG-AKL leg. Take cushions and break your journey!,good

The 380 seat was spacious with a large screen while the A330 was cramped and had the tiniest of screens. I gave such a poor rating for the recline due to when the person reclines completely in front you can't eat easily get out of your seat see the TV screen very well or feel like you can breathe. I didn't feel comfortable putting my seat all way back in consideration of the person behind. The seats also lead to people behind pulling on your seat when they try and get up and down from these cramped positions. I will try and avoid this aircraft in the future on AF.,good

We would repeat a previous comment that it felt like sitting on a wooden bench - had to stand up at regular intervals to get the feeling back in our legs!

This last trip 2 days ago I needed a fast direct flight so chose Air New Zealand. I paid an extra $95 for an exit row (air New Zealand are now an upscale budget airline with a cost for everything yet still charge. Premium fare)' the seat although had plenty of leg room is very very narrow more so than I ever remembered in the past and more narrow than the other airlines I fly. It was hard not to come into contact with the person beside me and we are both not big people. The recline is almost non- existent  and both seat pouches are beside the window making it hard for the person in the aisle. All in all I was very disappointed in what I thought were an above average airline.,good

Don't get me wrong the staff was excellent service was highly efficient and the food was reasonable. The seating however was so bad it's hard to describe. Probably the best way to describe it is that it is claustrophobic. I'm 6'1"" 200lbs broad shouldered 55 yrs old. I was in the aisle seat and next to me sat a woman who was probably 250lbs. There was zero personal space between us. In front of me was a passenger who insisted on having his seat fully reclined making the viewing of the seat monitor difficult because it was just too close. 12 hours of being squeezed into a configuration which left me feeling compelled to take a very long shower as soon as I could after arrival. I am absolutely confounded as to why Lufthansa chooses to treat its Economy customers like cattle!",bad

The only advantage of flying this A380 is you notice less noise on the cabin. The mood lighting was not that great because it was set only to red and orange LED all the time. My seat was on the upper deck with less seats and less people. I think it is always better to choose such seats. Being seated at the last two rows nearby the toilet (82E) might not be really pleasant due to the smell.,bad

The seats are comfortable, but are very cramped for anyone over 5'8"". My knees were touching the seat in front of me. However, for the price I'll put up with the cramped space for a few hours. Spirit does not offer Wi-Fi or any IFE, so there are no big boxes under the seat taking legroom - are we really that much of an addiction society that we need IFE and Wi-Fi on planes??",good

Although seats don't recline and the person at the front won't lean back and occupy your limited space hard shells are not comfortable when compared to other ordinary seats and I don't feel relaxed at all. These seats should not appear on an aircraft of a 5-star airline. If Cathay wants seats that do not recline so much and occupy one's place at the back maybe they could choose ordinary seats that could recline but with a max angle fixed so as to reduce effects on the person at the back.. On the other hand seat legroom was just acceptable not satisfactory enough and seat width was good just like other Cathay aircraft. Conclusion: Fixed shell seats not preferred.,bad

Premium Economy seat legroom is excellent and I'm 6' 3"" 240lbs - the seat cushion comfort is not. It's inadequate from a comfort standpoint for a long haul flight the cushions are thin and unsupportive the fabric does not hold you in position causing you to slide forward when utilizing the generous pitch the seat back offers. I found myself shifting my weight constantly just trying to keep my backside from falling asleep. The other issue concerns the foot rest on the PE seats it's irrelevant for anyone over 5 feet tall. Basically it's useless and difficult to fully extend even if you wanted to use it. As far as ingress and egress from the window seat get to know your neighbor really fast since you will need to get up and move around many time during the flight just to keep your sanity. The A380 and the flight attendants were great.",good

I was almost deafened by excessive noise from the aircraft engines? I was not impressed by the seat width or leg room and this aircraft performs poorly against Singapore Airlines for long haul. My blanket although in a sealed bag on opening was disgustingly dirty with food particles stuck to it! When I asked for another I was met with rudeness. We found the staff to be unhelpful. My entertainment system had to be rebooted. Our food was ok but there were no extra snacks during the flight. I was seriously disappointed with Etihad as I had thought from adverts that they were committed to great service and quality - but this is not the case in economy. Also the staff never checked seat belts once and I certainly didn't feel that in an emergency situation I would be relying on them for help which is standard in most airlines. I wouldn't book Etihad again in a hurry I will stick with Singapore.,bad

The plane is quiet and food was quite good too.

The legroom is more spacious and I didn't feel any uncomfortable thing as it gave me easier access to move around the cabin (the configuration is 3x3x3). The recline is also better than other GA economy class. PTV screen is more responsive however the entertainment still needs to be updated! GA's B777-300 is giving much better service than its other aircraft.,good

It was extremely cramped and I found it extremely difficult to sleep during the flight. I'm of a small stature and even I felt cramped. The in-flight pillows and blanket were scratchy. Their Boeing 777-300ER's are slightly better. If you ever go in economy sit on the in-flight pillows to create blood flow but use your own pillow or a jacket for your head if you are going to try to sleep on the flight.,bad

For economy I find their 747-400 superior. The leg room under the seat in front is much less there's some netting that you can put your feet into - useless. There is no room to store any extra luggage you may have under there and I'm not sure what the hype was about with the seat pitch? Just another note we flew with a toddler and whilst he was too big to use the bassinets 3 of the 4 were already out of order?!,bad

Not being in the least interested in business class the premium economy is an excellent alternative. However I do find the seat padding tends to set solid after about 8hours. I now have an additional cushion that that has largely eliminated this problem. Even double long haul legs ie LHR- HKG-AKL are good value and comfortable in these seats,good

Based on the hardness of the seats alone I would not fly on this aircraft again. We paid an extra charge to sit at the front of the upper deck economy cabin - do not waste your money - the aircraft windows are not aligned to these seats there is no side storage bin no above storage making it inconvenient to store items for take off and landing and no footrests. The only advantage is it is easier to get up from your seat. Service was not great for Singapore Airlines - and the hard seat - awful!,bad

Bathrooms were an annoyance even if people did not use the exit row to congregate (ceiling too low). Curtains had never been used to dim the lights coming out of the bathroom and cabin crew rudely instructed me that these were not to be used because they need to move around. Cabin crew comfort gets priority then. Seat comfort was poor because of it being quite hard and unclean. Seat was offered with a good recline but slowly went up all the time. Movies were on ceiling mounted 70's TV sets. Will never fly them long-haul again if not on rock bottom fares.,bad

It is great as know one is in front of you but there is no cut out for your feet. I know understand why people put their feet on the bulkhead. I wished I'd chosen a standard seat in the end! It's not cramped and if you're upright its fine but if you recline and want to stretch your legs you can't . Trade off I guess between that and no one in front of you. Made it easy to get out from the window seat.,good

We waited 2 hours into the flight for a drink or even for any acknowledgement from cabin crew. The plane had already been delayed by 1.5 hours and we also spent 45 minutes waiting on the ground before we could take off so by that point we felt quite neglected really. The pilot did acknowledge why we had been delayed but stated there had been a ‰ЫПmajor technical fault‰Ыќ with the plane ‰ЫТIn flight my partner‰ЫЄs TV kept cutting out and in the end froze for the remains of the flight so he had to read instead. I had last flown with VA ten years ago and have memories of comfortable seats adequate leg room attentive staff and good food. I do not know what they have done but I felt they have economised on all the above areas. On the return flight to London the pilot was very pleasant and reassuring speaking to us on a few occasions and acknowledging turbulence. Also although the TVs are temperamental the selection available of films and programmes is excellent really. I agree with the person above who suggested that the emphasis is now on PE. However as I cannot afford to travel PE I would shop elsewhere in future to see if it is still possible to travel Economy in comfort.,good

I hate flying long haul as I find the seats so uncomfortable on other airlines. We flew Qantas PE to LA last year via Sydney on their A380 and found the whole experience very average. What I love about the Spaceseat is that you don't have some clown reclining into your personal space forcing your food into your face or spilling your drink. The TV screen is fine just move it to a better position. There is plenty of room even for larger folk. It's so comfortable and the cabin is nice and private. The purple beanbag/footrest is very welcome. Flip your shoes off and settle in. The only thing that could be improved is the recline seating should be electronic buttons rather than manual. Ignore the negative reviews you will love this seat! Add to that the exceptional Air NZ service and you can't go wrong. I look forward to trying the PE in their new 787 planes but somehow feel that it will be a step backwards.,good

The person in front of me had his seat fully reclined the whole flight which was annoying but not as bad as some flights I've been on. It was difficult to eat my meal that way too. The aisles seemed especially narrow and I had to walk sideways to get to the toilet. Everyone had to move their legs/elbows/etc when someone walked down the aisle - doesn't seem very good.

Needless to say this makes a mockery of the ""more legroom"" selling point because now passengers have even less legroom when they ""recline"" their seats. And sliding the seat out from under the chair does not make for a more comfortable seating position since you slouch in the chair and be just as uncomfortable.",bad

Very cramped cabin with 3x4x3 configuration. The seat on the aircraft was like wooden bench. I felt that the seat on B777-200 on the way back to CDG was a bit better. Has AF improved the seat? Either way their economy seat is far from satisfactory. Also on the way back to CDG they ran out of food available between first and second meal. If you take a long haul flight with AF make sure that you take some food with you just like the time you take a budget airline.,good

Armrests seem quite weak don't stay upright if you want to lay down but you still can. Exit seats don't recline which is a pain. But if the plane isn't full then its all good you can stretch out.,bad

My husband is tall so we had asked for exit seats After arriving at the airport early (at 5.30 am in the hope of getting an exit seat) for a 10.10am flight. We were told sorry but all exit seats had already been reserved for Melbourne travellers (we are from NZ). The flight to Dubai was an horrendous 6 hours the seats were so close and five minutes into the flight while we were still climbing the woman and man in front of us put their seats back! It was a hell ride one we wont be repeating.,bad

The flight to Heathrow was full crew was friendly and professional. The food was nice and the amenities wonderful. The crew on the flight to SFO were a bit more flustered even though premium economy was sparse. They seemed to forget about me on a few occasions (not asking if I wanted things taking away other things making sure I was in premium economy and not economy etc.). They were definitely flustered. As someone mentioned previously I also noticed the premium economy bathrooms were opened to all in economy though the business class bathrooms were off-limits to premium economy passengers. I would fly premium economy again as what I saw of the economy seats were awful.,good

On check in we were dumped into row 63 the last row against the toilets these are seats normally set aside for V or W class fare passengers - and in this instance Thai cabin crew. It comes down quite clearly to a case of Thai overselling the flight. There is little point in paying extra or a full fare if it doesn't mean better seating.,bad

Was on the third leg of a 27 hour trip so tensions were already high when I walked on board. I was met with an archaic plane with the worst seats I have ever encountered on an international carrier. At 6'5 I usually sit in an aisle seat to gain some extra legroom however half my legroom was eradicated by a large metal box which were under every aisle seat. My extendable head rest would not stay in an extended position and my seat would not recline. My screen was also awful and unwatchable. When I asked to be reseated they told me no other seats were available despite the plane being 80% full and them trying to sell the premium economy seats before takeoff. After a 3 hr struggle to fall asleep my knee was hit by the steward and his cart waking me up and hurting my knee no apology or even acknowledgement was given. I complained to the customer service manager about the whole fiasco who simply said If I don't like it don't fly with them again. Don't have to tell me twice!,neutral

There are no exit seats on Qantas 747 Premium Economy only regular seats bulkhead seats and seats with back to bulkhead. 35a is the window seat second row in - I have to say the legroom is terrific no risk of banging my knees - also I could fully stretch my legs under the seat in front which I would not have been able to do with the bulkhead seat And the recline is very good though I believe less so if your seat backs onto the bulkhead (row 37). Only downside is you share loos with Economy. Noise cancelling headphones are good but the AVOD system is looking dated - A380 is much better. Foot rest is useless for taller people - they would be better off having an additional bar to flip out under the seat in front. Seat width is more than adequate for me being a narrow girth. It isn't business class - you have to pay alot more for that - but you do get treated more individually than in economy - and Premium Economy being a small cabin it feels more individual - Qantas get a big thumbs up from me for the overall experience.",good

Although there were two different aircraft involved each with a different seat configuration the seats were the same - the worst I've ever experienced. Very little legroom but worst of all the seats didn't recline. All that could be done was to slide the seat bottom forward which only gave the illusion of leaning back a bit. This put my back into a painful slumped position and because the seat back was still upright my head and neck were pushed forward. Within half an hour I had excruciating back pain which I couldn't get rid of regardless of how I positioned myself. On such a long flight as Vancouver - Hong Kong such seats seem absurd since it's pretty much impossible to sleep. I was miserable the entire time and could only pray that the seats between Hong Kong and Delhi would be different. They weren't. When the agonising trip was finally over and I was finally in India I kept having the awful realisation that I was going to have to sit in the same torturous seats all the way home again.,bad

I think this is one of the best seats to get in economy. You are the last to board and the first to get off. The seat is a window seat so you have the storage thing on the wall to your left to put things in where as if you were 48B or 48C you would have no where. It has part of the door sticking out in front of your left leg so if your over 6'0 you can't really stretch your leg out fully. I'm 6'4 and didn't have a problem with this as you can angle both legs to one side and not obstruct the person to your right and it was intrusive either.. and the best thing is this seat only cost $25 to book compared to the $160-180 they charge for the other extra leg room seats/exit seats (including the two next to you). People say the seats are bad and in August I said this myself I felt they were too hard but for some reason it was fine this time almost like the cushions have been replaced and I really enjoyed the ride. If flying on an A380 with 31"" or less leg room like Qantas you'll want to book a better seat as passengers behind you have no room and can hardly see the TV's quite ridiculous. The seats recline too much. I think a better foot rest would be better than 2"" extra recline.",bad

This gave me (175 cm ""tall"") at least some space to stretch out my legs on this night flight. Due to IFE and and an old fashioned overall seat design economy in Swiss' Y-class extremely cramped. It is odd to find yourself on a seat with more pitch on the connecting intra-European short-haul flight. The short-haul fleet on Swiss has been fitted with new Recaro-seats that offer a lot more space. Even though they might be a bit harder I would choose them over the current Swiss long-haul offering any time. If you are forced on a Swiss long-haul flight try to secure a bulkhead seat as these are the only currently acceptable Y-seats on Swiss' long-haul fleet.",good

Air Canada as a concession to passengers flying in aircraft without PE seating assigned us to ""preferred seats"" which in this case was 12A and 12C which were immediately behind the business class section of the cabin. Boarding was reasonably efficient but hampered by the rush of passengers scrambling to find storage for their massive carry ons. As we had no under seat storage we also had to scramble to ensure our few small carry ons were stowed. Our IFES and almost everyone else's on the port side of the aircraft did not work; AC did give us vouchers which when filed on line gave us a 5% discount on future bookings until spring 2015.

Virgin Atlantic changed our seat numbers to accommodate a family which is fair enough families should sit together. The seats we were allocated were awful behind the bulkhead seats - D&E. The family immediately reclined their seats and had no consideration for others. It was difficult to see the screen due to the close proximity it was extremely uncomfortable we struggled to get out of the seats due to the recline. Virgin should have put some thought into the fact that we were inconvenienced but they couldn't care less. I feel let down by Virgin and will probably shop around with other airlines in the future. Another annoying factor was that we were in the second to last cabin and there was no hot food choice by the time the cabin staff reached us. Overall a very poor service.,bad

It was without a doubt the worst flight I've ever flown as far as comfort. The flight was about 6 hours long. I thought Emirates was a top class airline. I was disappointed that they preferred to pack people in rather than aim for the comfort of its passengers. I requested an aisle seat and even the trolleys could hardly manage to make it through the aisles. Everyone had to walk sideways. I was hit and jostled constantly by people coming through (they could not help it). I am 1m73 and felt the seat already on my knees. When the person reclined it was even more uncomfortable. I spent most of the flight standing up rather than sitting in that uncomfortable seat. To make matters worse there was the video for the row in front of me on the floor where I should have been able to put my feet (the row in front was the exit row) so I could not even fully extend my legs! This was the first time and I hope the last time to fly Emirates.,bad

I had a window seat but the person next to me was a bit overweight. The side wall protruded into my seat area so I had very little space. The seat is very narrow and legroom is very minimal. It was impossible to put a drink and my laptop on the pull out table in front of me. The plane has very good storage bins above the seat an entertainment system (where almost everything costs $$) but the seats are horrible. I am a AAdvantage member but will make sure to never fly on an AA 737-800 again!!,bad

Your own mini-section the shell feature PTV better service are all perks. The downside is the padding‰Ы_- it is like sitting on a board. I brought an extra pillow to sit on but it didn't help that much. Secondly is the recline. It's odd and doesn't really recline - it slides forward. With that said take a look at the cabin behind to your rear and see how comfortable they look.,bad

We just couldn't get comfortable on the flight to get in a sleeping position. The sky couch is rendered virtually useless when the seats in front fully recline and reduce the seating space dramatically. There were two sets of people on our side of the plane with sky couch but neither used it. I made the mistake of booking a sky couch rather than an exit row that would have been a better and cheaper option for us. Air New Zealand pack an extra seat in economy and this reduces the width of seat and that may make an uncomfortable journey for wide people.,bad

The front row just gets a cushion for their feet after take-off. I prefer the leg rests the other rows have as they are adjustable. The recline was pretty generous and I didn't feel too crowded when the seat in front of me was down. The seat width could've been a bit wider. I had some room but if you are a larger individual you will fill up the seat. With my seat reclined and my feet on the leg rest in the top position I was almost all the way stretched out. (I am 5'6"") I found it very comfortable. For 2 people the side rows are great. They are just two seats and we felt like it was our own little area. Getting out of the window seat was pretty good. The VOD system was pretty good. They had a seat-to-seat text chat feature and games you can play against other passengers. The movie selection was good. They provide noise-canceling headphones and they worked very well. Welcome drink menu for meals attentive crew and self-service bar is awesome! There was always water juice beer wine rum and soda available also bags of potato chips. The premium section also has it's own restrooms - large and clean. Welcome kit included eye cover blanket toothbrush socks etc. I was very impressed with Premium Economy and thought it was well worth it for a 16 hour flight.",good

Squeezed in like sardines on both aircraft making the seats very narrow and ultimately uncomfortable. Travelled on 777-300 numerous times on long haul with a 3x3x3 configuration which was very good - Emirates 3x4x3 is a joke. Again huge letdown with the A380 seating arrangement. Priority seems to be numbers and not passenger comfort with Emirates - just don't get all the hype. Entertainment was great but I would far rather have seat comfort and a bit of room to move around in and an 'average' entertainment system than the other way around. Will use Thai Eva or Qatar next time even though it will cost a little more.,good

The seats in Swiss Economy are not suitable for people over 160 m. The space between the rows is so small that my knees touched the seat in front. In that position I could not see anything on the video-screen. When the front seat reclined the tray laid on my belly. You cannot recline the seat back to a decent rest position. Moreover the seat is very narrow forcing you to maintain permanently a straight seating position. The seats are not too bad but not sufficiently comfortable for a flight of over 10 hours under these conditions. On the return flight there was a box in my legroom underneath the seat in front which took half of my legroom. I could only place one foot under the front seat next to the box the other had to stay in the aisle which led to permanent problems with trolleys and other guests when passing my seat row. It was impossible to sleep and my legs and my back started aching after a few hours. I complained shortly after we left Sao Paulo but the Purser was not able and to my impression not willing to find a remedy. Admittedly the economy class was full but business was not. In any case it is brazenness to sell these seats as regular economy seats which are already very uncomfortable but it is torcher to place a grown up in such a seat on long distance.,good

I am about to end my long term relationship with KLM after this. I am 1.95m tall and not so thin, and was sitting with my wife and son in row 33 (all 3 seats), I was in the aisle seat. It was physically impossible for me to sit with my legs straight out in front of me there simply wasn't enough room to fit my bones between the seats, so I had to splay my legs outwards. On the outward aisle side my leg couldn't fit under the arm rest (which is fixed and can't move up) so it was digging into the top of my leg all the time. On the inside my leg was now in my son's seat space and my feet couldn't get under the seat due to the box on the floor. My son is also over 1.90m so he was already experiencing similar issues, without me using his leg room. All this was without the person in front reclining their seat.  We tried to lift the armrests to collectively give us more space, but they only go to about 45 degrees as they simply cannot fit between the seats at chest height so these were at best under my armpits. Third issue: just sitting in the seat my shoulder was touching my sons shoulder, pure and simply the seats are only as wide as a person, nothing more. Fourth issue: if my wife or son wanted to go to the toilet they had to climb over me to get out. Not ideal but if were not family this is extremely unpleasant for everyone involved. Bottom line: this is the worst long haul flight I have ever made with KLM, or any airline come to that. This has never happened to me before outside of one other (also with KLM) experience on a short haul flight (~2 hours), but for an intercontinental flight of ~10 hours this is terrible. Economy means budget and therefore maybe some discomfort, but it should never result in physical pain to anyone, or offensive intrusion of one passengers legs into another passengers seat space. In my 25 years flying with KLM this problem has only got worse, but became critical around the time KLM merged with Air France. KLM's relationship with it's passenger's has deteriorated to one of simply money - everyone buys a basic seat, but if you're tall or not thin then we (KLM) know you'll probably pay even more to get a slightly better seat. There is no concept of building a long term relationship with customers, or meeting their needs, so long as we make a few bucks out of you, we're happy even though we know you're not. Extremely short sighted and selfish attitude from a long time national carrier that should know and aspire to something better. KLM may think all its customers look at is the bottom line and that cheap is the name of the game, but if that's the case then why do they offer lots of seats at extra expense to avoid incredibly bad seat conditions.  It might surprise you to learn that if I'm going to have to pay a bit more to get a better seat then I'd be prepared to pay it up front to guarantee seat quality and comfort! That attitude builds customer loyalty and satisfaction, not fear, discomfort and pain!",bad

I am a 5'6""female & travelled with my 15yo son (5'10"") and husband (5'9"") - all of slim to average build - from Melbourne to Hong Kong. This was our first experience of these seats and the torture they induce. We each tried to cope with the unnatural shapes the seat contorts your body into by adopting different positions - enduring neck back and/or tailbone pain as a result. These seats are unquestionably the worst we have ever experienced I am just glad we left our 6' plus son behind. We assumed this was an old plane/old design; having just visited the Cathay site I am shocked to learn they are being lauded particularly given all the negative reviews.",bad

Airplane was so old that the TV screen was very small (maybe 4 inches length) and no possibility to see any video on demand. The movies started all together. Food from Lisbon to Brazil was simply horrible: a bland rice with chunks of a dry chicken. There was also a pudding whose taste I could not distinguish. At least the bread was good.,bad

It turned out to be the worst seat I've encountered in over 20 years of long-haul flying. The problem was that there was a box-like structure containing who knows what mechanism immediately under the seat in front of me which meant that I had leg room in the most literal sense - room for one leg! Fine for children or those missing a left leg lousy for anyone else. (I might add that I had more leg room on my 40 minute connecting flight to Canberra in Economy on a 737-800 than for the 12+ hours flight from London to Singapore.) I put up with it during the London-Singapore leg but mentioned my dissatisfaction to some crew members not long into the Singapore-Sydney leg. To their credit they were extremely sympathetic and helpful went looking for another seat and moved me to 48A downstairs an exit row which was very much better.,bad

These are the worst T economy long haul seats one could ever have the misfortune to encounter. The pitch is supposedly 31"" but I bet it's less. When someone reclines their seat the video screen is literally in your face. The top back of the seat curves inwards putting your upper back and neck in a very uncomfortable position. The minute I sat down in this seat I felt uncomfortable. This is an 11 hour flight and these seats are not even suitable for a few minutes. My back is sore now. I am an average height male 1.8m and weigh 80kg. Yes I am not a small child but I have flown most other long haul carriers in economy and none were ever this cramped and uncomfortable. It is really a shame because cabin staff were good and the food acceptable for economy. But the thought of spending another second in those torture devices fills me with dread. I will avoid VA economy long haul at all costs. I am so sorry I didn't book with another airline.",bad

It was inhumane! If the seat in front reclines you are trapped. The armrest won't come all the way up so a large person has an awful time getting out of their seat. I would hate to be in the middle of a row. Very bad and unhealthy seating.,bad

I checked out the Premium Economy on my way out of the plane and have upgraded for my return flight because couldn't stand another 12-hour flight in those uncomfortable seats. I think they were the hardest I've ever sat on. Felt similar to flying Easy Jet but those are normally a 2 hr flight so your bottom doesn't go numb! I resorted to using my inflatable neck cushion to sit on. The other problem was the lack of a foot rest. Having recently suffered DVT it was important not to have my legs hanging down for 12 hrs (even though I wear stockings and walk around every few hours); Virgin had told me incorrectly that there would be one. I think it's irresponsible to have seats with no foot rests on long haul flights given the incidence of dvts occurring after these flights; raising your legs helps the venous return. All in all a terrible experience.,bad

Had 30abc at the bulkhead and wow. 30c had more legroom than any other seat in the world as the bulkhead ends at 30b. Even 30a and b had the most legroom I have ever seen outside an exit seat. Seat width although was hampered by having a the tray table in the armrest and PTV being pull out. Overall a comfortable flight.,good

I'm quite tall and can't afford to buy the extra-legroom seats. I joined their frequent flyer programme in the hope of getting aisle seats but that didn't work. These flights were the tightest for legroom of any of the very many airlines I've used. Knees hard up against the seat in front with no chance of any movement - even worse when the seat in front recliners. On an 8 or 13 hour flight it's hardly bearable. Will not fly with them again.,bad

Pros: hard shell seat gives feeling of extra space and good AV (with noise reducing headphones and slot for own 'phones). Socket for laptop also handy tho' not used by me. Seat reclines (actually it ""declines"" in its shell) enough to aid sleep. Ticket class enables you to access AF lounge at CDG for a fee. The seat is very thin and very uncomfortable over a long flight. I bought a cushion in SCL for the return route but still had ""numb bum"". This detracts heavily from an otherwise good product. Please AF put some more padding in the seat cushion!",good

I am 6 ft of slim build and it was impossible to position my legs in the normal forward position. When the person in front reclined and I didn't it was impossible to use the seat back tray. It was impossible to achieve the brace position which makes a mockery of Monarch's pictorial display on its safety video. I will not fly Monarch again until I see that they have made an effort to provide adequate room for the normally proportioned and I advise others to think very carefully unless they are of small stature.,good

A very large passenger in the seat ahead of me kept her seat in full recline throughout the flight making it near impossible for me to eat or exit the seat. Also because of the fixed aisle armrest I literally needed to climb into my seat in order to step out into the aisle. This also put the monitor so close to my face that eye strain kept me from using the entertainment system to get a break from the torture. I will never again fly nonstop from Europe to the west coast of the US. The crew was friendly.,good

Leg room and recline marginal. Food horrific. Service average. Scratchy blanket. TV screen kept freezing and acting up. Just economy with a little bit more leg room and given the lack of comfort not worth it. I will never book this again and will not fly British Airways again - part of it is just a feeling of the crew not caring very much. Not very pleasant either being sandwiched between business class and first class which had lovely cabins service and reclining seats. Felt like a lower class citizen with the red rope across the curtains to first class. The food was horrific. No priority boarding. Last bags to be let off in Vancouver.,good

Legroom was not too bad but my legs dangled in mid-air the entire time with horrible discomfort under the lower thighs. Also the seating is incredibly hard and unyielding just couldn't get my head comfortable and my shoulders and neck still ache 3 days post-flight. We could not sleep on the Dubai-Perth leg as the people behind found the legroom too short and kept pushing our seats back whenever we reclined them. Terribly uncomfortable we will never fly with them again.,bad

When you fly the new Boeing 787 in economy, seats are a touch hard but still comfortable. Recline is fine and leg space is larger then many other airlines I have traveled with. Personal tv in the seat infront of you is an extra on these new airplanes. All my coments on the B787 are valid for their Boeing 777-200, same comfort.",good

KLM placed in the 2 seats next to me a couple with a 1 yr old infant and it was hell during the flight duration. The poor child has been crying and kicking me all night long and the mum that was seating beside me found nothing else to do to calm him down that shaking him nervously and shouting ""shhhhh"" at him all the time. The cabin staff came on a few occasions asking the dad to walk around with the child but that was clearly not enough to give a chance to enjoy the extra legroom and give me a chance to close my eyes. This was a very lousy experience that I do not wish to anyone. The comfort is quasi non existent in ""Economy Comfort"" class legroom is very standard seat width the same as anywhere else - and if you want to watch a movie you'd better pray that the person in front of you will not push back his seat.",bad

The seats are extremely uncomfortable with poor cushioning. Couldn't get comfortable at all. Front pouch space is a joke. Cant put anything there. Had to put my cellphone on the floor. I drink water quite a bit on long flights and there was no cup holder like on other planes (usually on under side of tray). Had to bring down the tray to put my water cup.

The new Dreamliner delivered a quieter flight with better air quality lighting and very little jet lag than its predecessors. The in-seat entertainment system in the headrest of the seat in front offered an above average selection of music movies and TV programming. The seat had a standard amount of space and reclining range compared to other economy cabins. I would recommend Norwegian for its value to comfort ratio.,good

So I checked on Sat, 18th and Sunday 19th and on both occasions the only seats that were available were 2+2+1+1+1, so 7 in total. Therefore I felt that I could not wait until Tues, 21st for online check in, as I wanted to ensure that I sat next to my wife. So with that in mind I pre-booked 2 seats 15a and 15b to ensure that we sat together and the extra еЈ50. However, when I checked the seat availability again on Mon, 20th and Tues 21st, I was shocked to see that there were plenty of seats available. When I saw this I felt I had been forced and cheated by BA to pay an extra еЈ50, this left a bitter taste in my mouth and was angry with the way I had been treated by BA.  The flight was delayed for 1 hour 40mins without an explanation as to why. Ok, these things happen but an explanation as to why were were delayed would have been appreciated.  By the time the cabin crew came round with the supposed lunch, it was close to 3pm and by the time the cabin crew reached us, they could not offer us a choice of food and the only thing that was left, was Fish. Therefore we were left with 2 trays of front of us with a salad bowl, a bread roll, an empty cup and an empty glass and a napkin with various cutlery, totally useless if you have no food to eat.  Eventually crew managed to find a Chicken dish that we could eat. The Club Europe cabin was not sectioned off to the economy class passengers. So these passengers were constantly walking past us to use the toilet facilities that were meant for Club Europe passengers.  After several complaints from myself and fellow passengers did they make an announcement over the PA about the facilities. However this did not stop the constant flow of passengers",bad

I was pretty concerned as when they were launched they received a lot of negative press as the legroom was alleged to be awful. Air New Zealand removed a row of seats in August to remedy this. It worked - I am 6'5 and with legs fully stretched could just about touch the back of the footwell - so loads of legroom. The recline could be a tad better but did not prevent me sleeping.

For a short journey of up to 2 hours its just bearable anything over this and its truly uncomfortable. You are forced to move your legs from side to side in order to endure the seat. The aisle seat is marginally better because you can swing your legs into the aisle; however this is hardly convenient.,good

The service particularly on the A380 was terrible as was the food on every trip. They were so late on both our legs out to Africa via Dubai we missed our domestic flight out of Dar Es Salaam and it cost us another $560 to get on another. Emirates stance is hard luck. We travel extensively and we will never use Emirates again. We hadn't used them for some years as we were not impressed then and had hoped that they had improved - alas they have deteriorated even more.,good

However the A380 does give much more luggage space above the seats so you can avoid putting things under the seat in front which is better. The seats have an ethernet jack and USB port but NO power sockets. Wifi is available at a small price; but using Wifi uses much more battery power in your laptop. Unless you're very lucky with battery life having no power socket is a serious disadvantage especially for cost conscious business travelers - but then again Lufthansa would like to see those in Business class anyway which isn't always possible. This negates the advantage of having Wifi available. The inflight entertainment system has an OK range of films and programmes. You can normally find 4-5 hours of viewing from the selection. The system however is quite slow and the touchscreens very temperamental. If you want more then bring a tablet computer with a long battery life loaded with films and avoid Wifi. The upside of Lufthansa is excellent service from cabin crew who seem to be constantly available if you need help.,bad

The cabin is much quieter than the main deck making it easier to sleep etc on long trips. The aircraft appeared to be new and was very clean and tidy inside. As for the seating itself economy class is not as comfortable as I expected with the seats feeling somewhat smaller and more cramped then the cozy older generation seats in the SQ B777-200 that flies from Singapore to Manila. The entertainment system food customer service however were all excellent on all my SQ flights. Being a rather small asian framed person I think it would be quite difficult for a 6ft European to travel long distances in the SQ A380 economy class but I doubt any other carriers would offer anything better without having to pay for business class. In terms of seat width legroom and access these seats felt no better than the Jetstar A330 that also flies Melbourne-Singapore. All in all I would probably take SQ again on my next business trip to Asia given their competitive pricing at the moment (SQ is at least $300 cheaper than Philippine Airlines when travelling between Aus and Phil). Changi airport is always a pleasure to use and as mentioned before the customer service with SQ is very good on and off the aircraft.,good

Pros- more legroom than the standard premium economy seats. Cons the tray tables are in the arms and not as large as the normal seats which makes working on a laptop a little less convenient. Overall I would certainly choose this seat again. I had a day flight both ways so did not try to sleep. Seat was comfortable for the duration and I did not find it too hard. As I was working most of the flight I didn't use the recline much but it seemed OK. The laptop power is standard 240V and either a standard French type or US plug will fit. It is limited in power and my laptop which is fairly low power would only work if the battery was taken out. That said the supply never faltered. Video was good with a reasonable large screen (although nobody could describe it as pin sharp) and a good choice of current films and TV shows. The earphones are OK but I used my own which plugged into a single 3.5mm socket so there was no need for an adapter. Service was OK not bad but not exceptional and the food was standard economy fare OK but nothing to get excited about. Overall a very pleasant flight and I don't think that I would have had much of a better flight in business class (but I wasn't trying to sleep). Overall plenty of room good comfort and easy boarding disembarking. Highly recommended.,bad

Moving to a standing position to squeeze out to go to the toilet was most awkward to say the least.,bad

Easy to stretch out legs under seat in front. Be aware that window seats and aisle seats on the centre section have the AVOD box. Probably best economy cabin I've travelled in.,good

I was forced into a window seat even though I am disabled to some extent. It was very difficult for me to get out of the seat given my disability. The aisle seat was better but not much. The seating was deteriorated and the arm rest on the center seat in front of me was broken. The seat mount on the seat in front of me was also broken or loose as the occupant in leaned severely to the left. All the seat problems slow service and the airline was late due to mechanical problems on the two connecting flights causing me to miss my flight to LA.,good

The seats were narrow and cramped. No legroom at all. Food was dreadful and very small portions. Offered a drink only once during flight. Aircrew not at all customer focused. Food almost thrown at you. No smiles please or how can I help. Also 2 stewards trousers and waist coats were threadbare and torn. What a disgrace to represent Virgin and Richard Branson. Will never fly Virgin again.,bad

Getting in and out was an effort and requires suppleness unless you climb over the armrests and slide into the seat. The seats seem hard in the beginning but on an intercontinental flight they are much better than a softer seat.,good

My wife and I travelled with our 5 year old. The flight was QF2 from Dubai to Sydney. We liked row 38. The seat reclined fully no one kicked the back of our seats and we did not have to be concerned shout reclining into someone's lap. In addition there was some space behind the seat to put blankets etc. The aircraft had large storage bins which took our hand baggage with no issues The seat location meant that we were close to a choice of toilets and also the self serve food area The cabin staff were excellent - friendly attentive and coming round on a regular basis with drinks and goodies (m&m's etc). The quality of the food was very good as was the range of drinks available. There was plenty to eat onboard and the self service area was topped up with goodies. Also Qantas serve good coffee and hot chocolate with marshmallows. There were never any queues for the toilets and we were not bothered by any noise from the nearby galley. However the seat is no where as comfortable as Emirates and although the IFE is good it us not a patch on Emirates The legroom is ok but when the seat in front reclines it reclines right into your lap making a long journey very uncomfortable. On a 13+ hour flight! there were no goodie / activity bags given out to our 5 year old and the choice of children's movies was quite limited. On our first leg a Emirates flight my daughter thought Santa was on the plane due to the huge amount of stuff she was given. We had a lot of turbulence and no warnings etc from the captain. On the Emirates leg the captain warned us in advance and then after some heavy bumps came on and reassured everyone that all was well. If I had the choice I would chose the Emirates A380 over Quantas' A380 on a long flight purely due to the much more comfortable seat better IFE and great goodies for kiddies. Thus outweighs (for us) our experience that Qantas have more friendly and attentive cabin crew. If we were to fly on the Qantas A380 it would be in the same seats or upstairs (review of our return trip to come).,good

There is no 'recline' available it just slides forward and pretends to recline. Leg room is marginally better than other economy seats since the back of the seat in front doesn't recline which is the only plus for this type of seat.

Don't think that you will get comfort or attention in this seat class. Row 1 seats recline to the point where they trap passengers in Row 2 with minimal space between rows and making is completely impossible to leave your seat during the flight. There is little equality in this booking class - Row 1 seems reasonable whereas Rows 2 and 3 seem like cages. A colleague in Row 3 experienced similar problems as I did: her seat reclined only part way and when the seat in front was fully reclines, she was unable to escape the fact that the seatback was so close to her face that eating a meal became an exercise in contortion. This seat configuration is a by-product of Jetstar squeezing in those extra seat rows to maximise their profit. This comes at the expense of the passengers' comfort and meant that my flight was spent longing for the Economy experience on carriers like Cathay Pacific with whom I have flown to S E Asia many times.",good

I've always been a huge virgin fan but this will be the last time we fly with them. The seats aren't that comfy although wide. An hour into the flight the couple in front of us fully reclined their seats. There was so room and myself and my 6 foot 6 husband had to sit with our legs at 90 degrees for the rest of the flight. I couldn't even get out to go to the loo there was such little space and spilled drink over myself in the process. It was extremely claustrophobic. I was hoping the return journey would be better but the audio didn't work to my entertainment screen. The flight attendant offered me a portable DVD player which i had to balance on my tray in an already cramped space. I flew virgin premium economy a few years ago and in my opinion they have placed more seats in the area to fit more people in as i don't remember feeling that cramped before. On a positive note all the flight attendants looked polished but i'm they have now lost my custom to Emirates or BA.,good

The combination slide-forward/recline is a good compromise that limits intruding into someone's space when reclining your seat. I wish they would have stuck with the 34 inch pitch found on their 777-200's. Those extra two inches really do make a difference.,bad

Whilst the actual stated pitch doesn't sound great they have really thought about how to maximise legroom: the safety and shopping guides are placed high up the seat in front and the seat is somehow very thin and very comfortable.

The cabin crew were efficient and effective although they did seem to leave it late to serve the snack.,good

The new WIFI Inflight entertainment was very nice and there is a booklet to tell us how to connect and it is helpful - although you may be confused for first time user. They also played shows on the overhead screens (without sounds though). Seat was comfortable and with good recline and plenty of legroom for tall people.,good

Our premium economy booking specifically stated SpaceSeat and the space seat was the entire reason for our booking. After boarding realised that we were on a777-200 so no space seats. Instead a very poor premium economy seat. Another passenger asked about the 300. In a rehearsed reply the attendant said 'oh that is on another route  this aircraft is new. 'Never again.,bad

On a six hour flight from NY to SFO I was given one glass of water.  They provide nothing. A beer is $7, ear plugs $5, movie $8 -  soon a blanket will be $5, a pillow $5. The worst part about the flight is not the lack of the above amenities which many of their competitors provide free, but it is those things they call seats! The seats are horrible. An appalling substructure with about an inch of padding with no lumbar support. I am 6' tall and 190 lbs. I had the seat back reclined and the person in front of me did as well. I was reading the in flight magazine and I had 1"" from my stomach to the seat in front of me.

I couldn't even fit my small purse and shoes under the seat in front of me without it spilling out to my foot space. When the person in front of me leaned back his seat there was no way for me to view the screen without bending down.

Also I have short legs and the absence of a footrest is a real problem - I had to place cushions on the floor & place my feet on them to ensure adequate circulation in my legs. My impression from 6 SIN-CDG legs is that the planes need a cabin refit with more comfortable seats. On the other hand I would rate AF ahead of Qantas's mediocre international economy offerings.,good

The storage bin alongside the window very useful. Seat 26K slightly awkward to get past 26J to the isle but not impossible. When the seat in front reclined still plenty of personal space. Seat 24K was an exit row seat with exceptional leg room but a lack of places to put things. The other problem with this seat is the window is slightly behind you so instead of looking forward and out you look directly to the side making it a bit uncomfortable to look out.,good

I'm not exceptionally tall at 6' but it was a struggle just getting into the (window) seat. Trying to avoid rubbing holes in my knees was a full-time occupation. I suppose this could even be intentional as there was no inflight entertainment of any sort. The whole routine of trying to get out of the seat meant I deliberately allowed myself to becone dehydrated so I wouldn't need to visit the toilet. I'm not convinced the seat pitch in business class was any better. ,bad

On the return the plane was full, and as I expected one has to get out of your seat to let the two people next to you get out.On a positive note the service was excellent and food good, probably because there are less seats upstairs.

Seat pitch and width were average. Personal space is definitely not one of the aims of the new product. The PTV was a nice addition though not all the B737-800s are fitted with them (ML series had a rather awful looking cabin and quite uncomfortable seats). Food was generally good nothing to complain about. Overall satisfactory for short haul flights but anything more than 3 hours might be a problem. Will try to avoid this Malaysia Airlines aircraft for medium haul flights.,good

This miserable airline had squeezed so many seats into the plane that there was no space even around the exit area - if there was an emergency it would be chaos! The next problem was the fact that Cathay economy seats do not recline so I had the trip from hell being over 6 foot as my head kept falling forward despite a support pillow. On this airline they think that by having the bottom of the seat slide forward you have comfort - wrong. I had no sleep in 24 hours.,bad

The reviews you will read about the 2x4x2 section at the very rear of the aircraft are true. 46K had more legroom space between the seat and the window and an overall feeling of a bit more privacy. The cons to 46K are that the armrest between 46J and K is a permanent one that cannot be raised or lowered. This might have eaten into the already slim seat width a bit but it did not bother me being 5'8"" and average size. Another con to being at the very back of the plane is that it takes a long time to deplane and they were out of the meal I wanted by the time they got to me. 28A was just fine but only because there was no one in the middle seat next to me. Originally there was and after the doors we closed the FA came and found him an aisle seat to move to. Before he moved however I was already sore from leaning against the window just so our shoulders wouldn't touch. Had he stayed there the entire 13.5 hr flight that would have been terrible. The 3x4x3 layout overall is a bad idea for passenger comfort. Not only are the seats shoulder- touchingly narrow but the other comments you've read about the aisle width are very true. I had to sidestep down the aisles to try and avoid bumping other passengers. And at meal/drink service time? Forget it. I did not have a problem with the lack of a footrest as some have commented. Sure it would have been nice to have but my feet touched the floor just fine and I'm 5'8"". If this is a problem for you I'd suggest using your carry on or as I read in a different forum bring a beach ball with you. When not inflated it takes up almost no room it costs $1 and if you partially inflate it it won't roll and makes a good makeshift footrest.",bad

This was unfortunately the most uncomfortable seat I sat in on a long haul flight. The seat looks good on the website when first looking at it. Air France makes its Premium Economy a real additional class. There are fewer seats per row. The seat is designed so that you have real isolated private space. You also have quite a lot legroom. Unfortunately the design of the seat itself is an outright disaster. The seat area itself is way too short even for short people. The seat hardly reclines at all. The footrest leaves your feet in an awkward cramped position if you do not happen to be extremely short - shorter than 160 cm like me. However not using the footrest will have your feet dangling in mid air. There is a leg rest that you can swing out but since the seat is too short it will hardly support anything. The seat is a disaster or an overnight long haul flight. Air France should feel ashamed charging extra for these seats. And it is not peanuts for us it was almost the double compared to Economy class fare.,bad

The problem was the hardness of the seat and a ridge running accross it. The padding was very thin at the back and probably old and compressed (I pulled the seat cushion up to have a look) and there is a pneumatic cushion at the front of the seat so that you can change the thigh support (via a small button on the front left of the seat cushion operating a valve. There is also a similar pneumatic lumbar support). The problem was firstly the hardness of the seat and secondly the junction between the foam and this pneumatic cushion which caused a ridge that cut into my upper thighs. The overall result is a very uncomfortable seat. Both flights had the full AVOD system which was nice and service was good (but not as good as on the A380) as was the food. The seat would not put me off flying SIA again as the A380 was good and staying overnight at Changi was excellent (40 minutes from aircraft arriving at the gate to checking in at the airport hotel and fantastic and incredibly cheap food at the food court on B2 level) but in future I'd try to fly on the 777-300ER which I believe has the same seats as the A380.,good

While this is good there is limited (a small locker usually filled with blankets or other equipment) to no overhead storage and you either have to place your cabin bags in lockers further back (making them difficult to retrieve inflight and on landing) or hope the crew will place them in the crew cupboard in the bulkhead area (some are happy to and some are not!). There is no window at these seats and also no side storage bins. Most significantly the seats are next to the bulkhead section where the baby bassinets are located (there were one or more screaming babies on each leg!). It may be advisable to go with similar seats further back where you may only have people milling around waiting for the toilets.,bad

Seating in a window seat proved difficult getting in/out of when two other passengers were sound asleep. With barely enough room for my carry on it was reduced even more when in the recline position as the footrest took up additional space. The seat in front of me reclined is seat and almost cracked the top of my laptop. The connecting flight was no improvement as my leg room was confiscated by the IFE box located in the seat in front of me. On the return I paid the additional upgrade fee to sit in economy plus - well worth the extra bucks! The seats are 2x2 with good leg room and seat width.,bad

They have removed all storage in the seats and reduced the size of the fold down tray so they can have the seats closer together. Removing the seat back pocket probably allows an extra row of seats or more. However it means the fold down trays are so small you cant fit anything on it. Not a drink as well as the food tray It also means there is not storage space for any personal items - water bottle or books or magazines. The is a very slim magazine rack high on the seat but it is already full with the Thomas Cook mags. The seats do not recline and have very thin upholstery. The most uncomfortable I have ever been in. For a 4 hour flight from Turkey. I will never fly with them again and would advise anyone to avoid using them. The food was okay but a half portion of what other airlines provide. More like a hot snack. Service okay but they tell you to clean the aircraft before you leave. A bit difficult if there is zero storage room and not enough room to reach the floor.,bad

Airport staff should enforce the rule of one 8kg carry on luggage in the cabin per person it is unfair to passengers that board late and find themselves no room to put anything in the overhead compartments.,good

Only reason seat is recommended is if you have to be on this type of plane an aisle seat is best option. Seat height poor for taller people cramped overall. 3 drop down TV's for economy and 11 channels of entertainment in this day and age is simply unacceptable especially on long haul. Not enough aisle room to stretch and of you did little way to avoid blocking views of TV for others. Ticket cost up airline margin up everything else shrinks - customers first - not a chance! Same flight for 20 years - satisfaction steadily falling over last 10 years as comforts disappear.,good

I requested an emergency exit seat with more legroom only to be told that I would have to pay an additional AU$160! However the services desk informed me that if I wanted an exit seat and sat by the window I would not have to pay anything at all - given that there was the section over the door sticking out which would result in my legs being slight angled but not in the way of the passenger next to me. Well worth it and saved me the money and I would recommend anyone wish for more legroom. Made getting in and out of the seat great and one needs to stretch the legs regularly on such a long flight.,bad

In the recline position however you get pretty much no back support as you end up sliding down (below the head rest) to get into any type of position conducive to sleep. For flights under 5 hours I would choose these seats over standard reclining seats. You have good view of the screen there's a power outlet and you can enjoy the inflight entertainment. Where Cathay made the mistake is for long haul flights where people are inclined to sleep for some portion of the flight. For sleep these are absolutely the worst seats. I think they made a mistake in installing them on their trans-continental flights. In an ironic note if you don't want to sleep on your flight these seats are the best. If you want to sleep choose a different airline. If you want to stay awake the whole time (which for flights arriving at night in either direction helps with the jetlag) I would choose Cathay.,bad

It was a truly horrendous experience that I would not wish anyone to repeat. The legroom was fine until the person in front reclines their seat. I was left with no room for my legs and had to have them parted around the seat in front. The meal was served late lights out was only for a couple of hours (on an overnight flight) and nothing was done about people yelling and being rowdy during lights out. The food was so awful that I turned down the second meal. Seats can be booked 3 months in advance which is awful. We encountered several couples who were unable to sit together (including a honeymooning couple) because there were no seats left in pairs! A truly awful airline.,bad

None of us got a wink of sleep on this 8+ hour flight. Not sure why but these seats which I found very comfortable on a day flight with a little recline just don't seem all that comfortable when fully reclined at night. I could still get in and out of the seat OK with the ones in front fully reclined but I could not get to sleep.,good

There was so little room between that seat and mine that I wasn't able to use the lap tray for my computer. The distance between adjacent seats was minimal so buckling seat belts was an arduous task. This plane is probably fine for 1 hour flights but on 7-8 hour flights it's horrible.

The legroom is impeached by the entertainment box attached to the seat with make seating straight impossible even for my short legs. The aisle seat's inconvenience are the entertainment box and the reduced aisle which will provide you a bumpy ride from other passing passengers or carts. If you think the middle seat is your saver. When you recline the seat is move forward which turn your knee as an entertainment tv stand. I would advise that you fly Qatar Airways Airbus or Boeing 777 where comfort is very satisfactory.,bad

There are just 5 Economy rows on the Upper Deck of the A380. Heaps of legroom but 35F and the adjoining seats become a defacto walkway for other passengers going to the toilet. In the dark they trip over your feet. 35J has the same legroom and as the space leads to nowhere you don't get other passengers stumbling over you. The huge downside to these seats is the almost absence of overhead bin space for your stuff. Even worse 35JK do not have a seat pocket in front so nowhere to put small items you use during the flight. Look good on paper but not good in reality.,bad

We flew from Vegas to Gatwick and chose to pay for the upgrade as we wanted more space more service and to feel rested on arrival. There is no lounge access the seats are cramped the service was pretty ordinary - and we felt very disappointed. If this is premium I shudder to think how small the economy seats are. I am not a big person and whilst I could stretch my legs out - the reclined seat in front of me made it almost impossible for me to get in and out. You definitely want an aisle seat - I was in a middle seat. The head rests move when you try to put your head weight against them. I think you would be much better off paying for more legroom and extra luggage in economy if available - it would be cheaper and much the same result. The seats are definitely wider than standard - which was the only really positive thing I can say about it. They even charge you if you want more sparkling wine in the flight - hardly a premium service. Got virtually no sleep.,good

I had thought that Turkish Airlines was a good quality airline but the experience was similar to flying on easyjet. We had seats in row 8 which has no row of seats behind it - seats B C D and E I would definitely recommend especially if you like to recline. Seats A and F I would not recommend as they couldn't recline at all - though my seat seemed not to be fully upright with a very curved seat back and I got a bad headache halfway through because of the inability to sit up straight. I wouldn't recommend paying for business class as the only difference was seats were 2x2 and food was served more regularly. There was only a flimsy partition to separate from economy. Overall the seats were okay width-wise and seemed to have a good recline (apart from mine). There was also a small fold-out metal footrest and the headrest wings moved forward or backwards.,bad

Some of the facilities (restrooms etc.) were also slightly older-looking. However I understand that China Airlines does have some newer 747s with personal televisions at every seat as well as nicer seats (I've been on one of these as well) and these are much more suitable for long-haul flights.,good

While the Premium Economy price is considerably more than the economy we have willingly paid the difference for the comfort experienced on the long haul. Over the years we have experienced a variety of seating arrangements from the noticeable wider seats with more leg room to the ""moon seats"" which proved extremely uncomfortable and ultimately to the 777-200 flight which offered us the worst imaginable flight experience. The seats on our last trip to Queenstown and return were much narrower. We questioned our memory of past flights and finally checked the economy seats. Unfortunately economy seats did not look smaller than the premium economy. Our trip on January 4th this year to Queenstown found us on the long haul flight bumping elbows as we sat. There was no extra room to turn to choose a comfortable spot for sleeping. To use the phrase ""disappointing"" with reference to our latest trip and my own flight to Queenstown last May of 2014 is an understatement. The cost of our travel from Toronto to Queenstown was very close to $10000 for two adults. When advised by two friends who also traveled to Queenstown one week after us that their individual economy fares were in the region of $2500 each I am left wondering why so much was paid for so little. The premium economy accommodation would seem to be excessive in light of the meagre room afforded to your patrons of this class. I would be interested to know why customer care has been cut back and to what end. The crew are wonderful and every attempt is made within the cabin to accommodate travellers. Too bad that travel space is now cramped for premium economy patrons.",good

The seats are pretty thin and firm but I had no problems getting and staying comfortable for our 11 hour flight. Legroom was adequate (which is all you'll ever get) and as it's 2x4x2 it's not really that hard getting out of the window seats. IFE was pretty good - not the largest range of films available about 40 or so but there was at least 5 I would have watched. Service was excellent and food was okay. As far as economy goes Lufthansa were pretty good. Not amazing but good.,bad

IFE box was under the seat in front of me but to I was not too bothered by it. The seat is away from the cabin wall and this gives you several windows and a sensation of space. You get your own storage space between the seat and the wall which can also serve as a table. Although it will be shared with the person behind you. Getting things in and out of it means removing anything sitting on top. The IFE was okay selection of programs was fair. However to select anything on the screen you had to press hard which makes you shake the seat in front of you. I had to endure that from the lady behind me. Food and drink service was very good for Economy.,bad

The plane was amazing, though, and it was quite an experience to try out the new Dreamliner. The windows dimmed by pressing a button, cabin pressure and humidity was higher and you could feel the difference after a long flight. Cabin crew service was great and the food was, as usual, really tasty and of high standard. I will fly ANA again.",bad

We scored an upgrade (paid) to Business on the way back and although the ability to sleep on an actual bed on an overnight flight was a real plus we found there was a lot less personal space in Business compared to Premium Economy. The downside was having to fly economy-class Auckland to Adelaide (single class plane only). I literally had to get out the seat 3 times during the 4 hour flight as my leg became so numb I was concerned any longer locked in that position would lead to serious health issues. I was unable to point my foot upwards and had to sit locked in a splayed position whilst seated. I can't imagine how I would have coped with a 12 hour flight in that position.,good

Everything was narrow: the seat the aisle the virtually non-existant legroom the food tray. It was hell trying to get any sleep as there was very little space in which to move around to change positions. The only remotely comfortable way of getting any sleep was by reclining the seat when the person next to you wasn't reclining theirs. And the seat didn't recline much I've had better reclining seats in local buses. Theb other issue was the food tray; it was narrow although it fitted everything served. However dinner time was an issue since there wasn't enough room for everyone to eat comfortably without knocking down your own stuff or the stuff of the person next to you. In short quite an uncomfortable experience. I endured both a short flight and a ten-hour flight and they were both hell.,bad

These seats are located immediately behind a service bulkhead and afford a lot of legroom. The IFES and table tray are located in the armrests as is the remote control for the IFES and overhead lights etc. We found the trays easy to deploy but it took both arms and a lot of effort to get the IFES unit out of the armrest. When deployed it was difficult to view as it was somewhat offset by the armrest or the tray (if deployed). The remote control is on wired tether which often tangled with other items and accidentally turned lights on or off or called cabin crew unnecessarily - annoying. The seats are leather-faced and comfortable. An amenities kit is provided with pillow and blanket. The seats are close to washrooms. When cabin crew were accessing the bulkhead storage there was a tendency to hit my feet with the door. Also this is a service area for c rew so it can be noisy as can be the sounds of passengers walking to and from the washrooms. Overhead storage is plentiful. Meals were excellent as was the crew service. For overseas flights it is worthwhile paying extra for the comfort. If we had to do this again we would probably choose seats farther back in this 24-seat cabin to avoid the bulkhead closet crew activity and washroom sounds.,bad

If the there was no loyalty scheme I wouldn't fly with them anymore. Here's why - the seats in economy are small and have limited legroom (31 inches). They no longer offer any of the great benefits they used to. The amenity kit has gone and the meal has been reduced to its most basic form. Anyone who flew Virgin in the good old days would be amazed at what it's turned into. I have flown all three classes and the emphasis is now all about Premium and Upper. Virgin is all style over substance these days. It all looks amazing in their fancy commercials but the reality is that if you can only afford to fly economy they really don't care about you.,good

Outbound I stood up for 7 hours from SYD-SIN as cabin crew decided my leg was sticking out too far and there was insufficient room to get my leg under the seat. On the return my seat offered better leg room but despite many empty seats BA allocated two large men next to me. I had to have my carry on case to keep my leg elevated which meant the two men were trapped in their seats. BA didn't ask to see my Dr's letter to understand what I was going through. The staff did their very best to avoid all eye contact with passengers (presumably in case we asked for something!). My headset socket didn't work but the staff just blamed the previous crew. I could write about the state of the toilets but I'd rather forget what I saw. Suffice to say I drank nothing on the flight to ensure a bathroom visit was not required. My experience with BA has left me quite certain I will never book them again.,bad

Above seat lockers dropping open on take off lap tray falling apart. Absolutely the worst plane and long haul journey I have experienced. Do not waste money on World Traveller plus and preferably never choose a British Airways B777 for long haul travel.,bad

I am 6 foot 7 or 199 cm so I went after an emergency seat but on all 4 flights I was punished. and the trolleys kept banging my knees. Ground staff apparently didn't care (they very well noticed I was the tallest passenger) and the crew (after my complaints) had no comments on any of the flights. It was a terrible journey very painful.,good

Hardly any legroom or footroom and inward curve of plane made it even more cramped. Seat did not recline at all and was very narrow. Screen impossible to see anything on. Wonky seat tray which had to be pulled out of armrest and refused to go back after had to be forced back by one of the crew with some difficulty. Meal prebooked but offered no choice given curry that resulted in digestive upset later. All in all a very unpleasant experience. Flew back seat 5e. Also very cramped knees hitting back of seat in front all flight. Width marginally better because no tray storage but screen still impossible to see. Only saving grace was the crew who remained cheerful and attentive throughout. These were the most uncomfortable journeys I have suffered for 30 years. Easyjet is luxury in comparison.,good

Outbound flight my wife and I were stuck with two seats on the left of a four seater in the middle of Economy - not great and leg room was poor (especially when seat in front reclined). On return sector selected two seats together during online check-in at the rear of Economy where the aircraft narrows - meaning the configuration switches from 3x4x3 to 2x4x2. Much more legroom and plenty of storage space - plus decent accessibility. Generally the seats on the BA 747s are reasonably comfortable and have a clever adjustable headrest which provides good neck support. The seats are not the new slim-line versions used by other carriers and so have decent padding. Definitely adequate for a 7 hour flight - but am sure on long flights to HKG SIN SYD or NRT discomfort could become an issue. Both B747s we traveled on must have been over 15 years old but in good shape - clean cabin and toilets etc. No issues with food and service was good (although an observation - BA don't tend to station cabin crew in the Economy cabin during boarding to assist passengers with luggage / finding seats etc - unlike Middle-Eastern / Asian carriers). Only real issues were overcrowding at BA's Terminal 7 as JFK and the IFE screen very small. BA charge a extortionate amount to pre-book seats prior to online check in opening. Best advice is to just complete online check-in early to ensure best seat selection.,good

After flying with them I can honestly say the negative are correct and I'm somewhat dubious if the positive are real. No leg room unless you pay extra for leg room cost me $134 Australian dollars. Narrowest seats in the market and their entertainment system had to be rebooted 3 times. The staff were the only positive attribute. Fly Emirates or Virgin they actually seem to care more I've complained since returning. It took them 4 days to reply with a very basic holding email.,bad

Advise- find an aisle seat even if attempting to sleep. Better yet pay the extra $50 to get on JetBlue or Virgin America. For those interested in inflight entertainment there were only fixed TV's glued to the ceiling every so often.",good

It was so worn by use one's body could not sit naturally in it. You felt yourself slouching or sliding forward the whole time and could not correct yourself. LOT also does not have video on each seat instead it is a projector at the front of the cabin so the closer you are to rows 5 or 19 the better view of the video screen (which randomly turns on and off). Lastly the sound quality and physical/mechanical quality of the headphone inputs were horrible!,bad

Usually the extra cost is about еЈ500 and I try to use points and money to further upgrade but that is usually a lottery and not often successful. I followed a similar procedure with a BA flight form LHR to JNB on an A380 and was in premium economy on the upper deck at the front bulkhead so leg room was not a problem but the seat itself was very disappointing compared to other BA flights I have been on in essence it was a an economy seat with more leg room and a worse than useless leg rest which did not come up far enough to support your legs comfortably. In addition BA are missing a trick as these 7 bulkhead seats could have a small food rest attached to the bulkhead so you could stretch your legs out completely. A further premium could be charged I am sure not dissimilar to the practise of many airlines. In future on this route I will save my money and fly economy as I did not see a еЈ500 premium in the seat еЈ300 tops. (I have just had a look at the BA web site and the same return flights as mine for next week has an еЈ1800 premium utter madness),good

I'm used to cramped economy classes on different airliners but this was an extreme experience. My knees were deep inside the forward seatback. Poor guy in front of me tried to recline his seat but it was impossible. I couldn't recline my seat because of a very bad design of the seat; when you try to recline your seatback the seat itself moves forward for one or two inches. I couldn't get my feet under the forward seat. There I sat jammed in my seat for 10+ hours. My knees and leg muscles are still sore after two days of that flight.,bad

This is for window seats row A. All the window seats (and in K too) seemed to have this same problem. As a result you either have to sit diagonally with both legs on the left side or do the splits with a leg on each side but the problem with this is that the left leg's calf muscle will have the corner of the foot rest jar up into the muscle causing pain after some time. Also when fully reclined it is difficult to get your feet under the seat in front of you. The concept is good but the execution is utterly terrible and I was very disappointed not to sleep for the 10-hour flight because of constantly trying to juggle one of the above two positions neither of which worked. Shame on the engineers here.,bad

The seats are comfortable and leave plenty of room for larger westerners to stretch. The aisles are narrower, but no different than domestic airlines in the states. PTV had a great selection of movies and music; my only complaint would be the TV show programming. They feature a lot of popular drama shows from the USA, but no comedies.",good

The seats were extremely narrow short and very hard with very little leg room. It became impossible for me to get comfortable in any way to be able to relieve pressure on my legs or sleep on my flight. There was absolutely zero room for anyone to get out of his/her seat to go to the restroom without having the entire row get up as well to let them out. I will never fly with Air France again because of this level of discomfort.,good

My tv did not work and although there were a couple of open seats 21 rows back I chose not to move seats and before we landed at LAX the First Attendant/Purser visited my seat and gave me some gifts and an apology for the inconvenience; I thought that was quite generous of him.,good

The first sector was on the main deck seat 48K (window) 3x4x3 and the next seat on the upper deck 74K (window) 2x4x2. The seats were well designed and ergonomic however the seat cushion was extremely hard probably the worst I have experienced on a longhaul flight. After two hours I was in pain and had to stand up. The seats have foot rests but these are almost useless for a tall person and when those in front are fully reclined it it almost impossible to get out without the people beside you getting up. The upper deck seating configuration in economy is generally much more pleasant typical of A330/A340 cabins.,good

I was nervous about flying on my own with a baby but had no problems. The passengers I sat next to we're very friendly and helpful which was a godsend. A380's have great space if you need to stretch your legs (this is compared to other planes you are still in a plane you're not going to be able to jog around). Food nice entertainment looked excellent seats were hard so had to try and work it a comfy position. Probably impossible. They weren't worse than a lot of other airlines. Didn't like Dubai airport - so busy and airside hotel not open in the A380 terminal and after asking unhelpful customer services how I could get to the other terminals I only had an hour and they only had smoking rooms.,bad

The seat is wide comfy and there is plenty of leg room to stretch out. The recline is lovely too because it really does enable you to doze off at will. The food that was served was perfectly fine and filling. IFE is superb. It caters for all tastes and after your meal and just a little too much to drink you can drift off into one of Hollywood's latest offerings something from TV a game of football or catch up on the latest news. Premium economy reviews shouldn't make the mistake of comparing to business class it isn't a flat bed. What it is though is a very comfortable seat with great service and fantastic IFE.

A tremendous benefit yes but it's still an airplane getting you from A to B long-haul. Presumably had same food as Club World (this was a three- class airplane) no preflight bubbly. Outbound flight overnight -- seemed like an airborne campground with litter everywhere. Homebound in daylight much neater. Pricey. Can't see me sitting in economy for ten hours over eleven hours back. Wedged in. Leg room is worth it.,bad

The AB side of the aircraft are served first for everything so you have a better chance of getting the meal of your choice on that side of the aircraft rather than the JK side. All seats are much much better than normal economy and definitely worth paying the extra for the premium ecnomy (world travelller plus as BA call it) especially if you can get seats in the pairs of AB/JK rather than the 4 in the middle. Window seats can be difficult to get out of when the person next to you in the aisle seat is in a reclined position and asleep.,bad

I'm 6'2"" tall and found the legroom to be adequate. Not great but adequate. The aisle seat would be the best bet for tall people.

Started trying to check-in and choose seats 24 hours before departure. Failed on all counts. Called London from hotel four times. Promise made to put note on Boston file but no record of call admitted by ground staff on our arrival at the airport. Row 31 is the first middle group of four seats behind the bulkhead separating Upper from Economy Class. My partner and I are not fat people but we could not fit ourselves comfortably into these extra narrow seats with airbags attached to the safety belts which were using up even more of the limited width. A kind young man offered me his exit seat as I suffer from arthritis in my hip. My partner was not so lucky. She spent the entire night flight with her arms crossed (as the passengers either side of her had taken both arm rests. Virgin Atlantic. Why does Virgin Atlantic online check in system not work and why are they offering four seats on a plane that even slim people cannot sit comfortably in? If any passenger is offered a middle row 31 seat and is larger than a size 8 to 10 for your own good cancel your flight and fly with someone else.,good

Find the new A380 economy seats incredibly hard and uncomfortable with poor pitch and lousy legroom for long journeys far prefer the old seats. SQ heats the cabin more than comfortably. Seem to offer the same food for the same route month after month after month. Far too popular so no longer can get choice of seats better value for money out there.,bad

The seat bottom is too short the seat back is slumped or slouched even when fully upright and forces short-legged passengers to plant their feet into the floor to keep their hips from sliding forward and grinding their tailbones into the seat. The backs recline too far back to be practical in such an absurdly tight-packed cabin and will interfere with use of tray tables and hurt the knees of tall passengers unfortunate enough to sit behind a reclined seat. The armrests are far too low to be useful at all and dig into the thighs of virtually any average-sized adult. These seats are good only for illegal forms of ""enhanced interrogation"" and nothing else; three days after this flight I am still sore and have small bruises from the crap armrest digging into my leg. I'll do anything to avoid this terrible flight in the future. A general rule for those looking for good seats: Avoid 737s altogether especially the 800/900 series since those planes tend to be utterly crammed to the gills. It's just getting worse all the time.",bad

Under the seats you have a large box which contains entertainment electronics. This restricts your leg space by 25% and is outrageous to have this unit here. The edge of the metal box cuts into your leg making it very uncomfortable. Truly horrible.,neutral

Cabin service on the outward leg was good and attentive (we were told there was a supervisor on board) but I was surprised that the space around the seats was extremely confined and that the in-flight ‰ЫПentertainment‰Ыќ did not work. The distorted sound from the headset made watching any film impossible and the touch-screen system did not allow one to follow even the flight map. Food was just about edible (in spite of what the menu cards promised). It was served in cardboard containers but bedecked with linen tray cloths and a set of cumbersome metal cutlery. The return was another story. On boarding we were warned that alcohol service would be restricted as the outbound flight had virtually drunk the plane dry. Personally I did not find this a problem on a night flight. However cabin service this time was sparse to say the least. With the dinner bread rolls were not offered beyond the first two rows and there was no chance of refilling the miniscule ‰ЫПchina‰Ыќ coffee cup. The much-vaunted liqueur service turned out to be a glass of brandy - no choice. Sleep was impossible. The seats had obviously been designed for a greater pitch than had been afforded. If the person in front employed the ‰ЫТlimited- possibilities for reclining their seat the surrounding design ensured that you were trapped in yours. If you used the footrest your knees almost hit your chin. Breakfast was similarly awful. I am relieved to say that being at the front of the queue for boarding and disembarkation did have its advantages but I feel obliged to report to others that I regard the Premium Economy service that we received a vast waste of money. One would do far better to purchase extra leg-room seats in Economy Class and investigate taking some of the excellent locally-available snacks to sustain one on the journey. To say this service is over-hyped is an enormous understatement. We are contemplating another visit to Cuba but are giving serious consideration to extending our journey time and using Dutch or German carriers.,bad

Plus the distance between the seat rows is very narrow especially if one is just little bit taller. It's a pain getting into the seat if your seat is not an aisle seat. This definitely got worse over the last 7 years. Plus the space to stow some small items like a case for glasses or a small bottle of water basically disappeared over the years.,good

I guess that Asiana is trying to squeezing more space for fitting in more economy rows. If you are flying regional say 4-6 hours and it is fine. I am not recommending for flying a long haul flight with A380.,bad

The seats are a step up from the shabby WT+ seats on the 747-400 we had on our outbound flight. The seats were ""slimline"" with very little seat padding and poor lumbar support. Probably the best feature of the new WT+ seat is the larger AVOD monitor built into the back of the seat in front. The new AVOD system is far superior especially the moving map function. There is a foot rest that drops down from the seat in front; it's nice but doesn't add much to the experience. Lavs (just two of them one on each aisle) are located just aft of the WT+ cabin and are shared with the main WT cabin; otherwise you have to hike back to the very rear to make use of the lavs there. Like other BA long-haul aircraft the 777-300 does not have passenger air vents above the seats in WT or WT+. Because the cabin temperature is kept at near-sauna levels the lack of vents can make the trip very very uncomfortable. Perhaps the biggest shortcoming is that leg-room is restricted by two metal equipment boxes under the seats in front. The boxes restricted the ability to stretch legs and effectively prevented storing any carry-ons under the seat in front. While the new WT+ has its short-comings it is still far superior to anything offered by US carriers as a premium economy product. For us the positives were worth the cost belong regular WT and in any event the cost of WT+ was far less than what we would have paid for Club World.",good

The cabin is poorly thought out we were left begging for water as you are competing with 200+ Economy passengers for service toilets and snacks. The cabin was shabby seats in disrepair and video screens faulty - just as tired and knackered as the cabin crew who treated the Premium Economy passengers as an after thought. Example - the passageway going aft to the toilets was blocked by crew dealing with a sick economy passenger one cabin crew let PE passengers go forward into the Business class cabin for the toilet another actually shouted at PE passengers for doing the same. On the way back they ran out of meals and gave us the same meal as economy. Absolute waste of money - never felt so looked down upon by cabin crew.,bad

If you are after seat pitch then row 68 (the window seats on both sides) offer more legroom than others due to the curvature of the cabin and the spacing of the rows - although consequently the aisle seats in these blocks appear to have slightly reduced seatpitch - so access past a neighbour could be an issue.

Whilst it's perfectly comfortable and balances squeezing in seats and respectable legroom somehow it felt smaller than their seats on their A330s and B777s (which I've also flown). Otherwise the IFE was amazing and the service was good. Due to the seating arrangement 71H is an undesirable seat (next to a galley rather than other seats) so may be unoccupied on a quieter flight.,good

Plus people who seem to feel the need to constantly push back in their seat makes your table shake making for an unpleasant dining experience. It was very difficult to get in and out of the seat and I was in an aisle seat. I have bruises on my legs and my right knee bruised from knee being up against the seat in front of me. The armrests do not go completely up so I can see the other passengers being bruises from banging against them every time they try to get in and out of their seats. Worst seating.

The seats were the old WT+ and showed their age in all respects (worn dirty etc); the AVOD monitor for seat 29J was so badly scratched and smeared that it was difficult to watch anything. The cabin was unbearably warm; be aware that BA's long-haul fleet evidently do not have seat air vents - so no way to keep cool. Seat 29K has no seat in front of it which makes leg room excellent and also allows for easy access to and from the seat to the aisle and area around the exit door. Seat width is poor and the seat has function buttons (and AVOD controls) on the inside of the arm rest making access and use very difficult. While it's true that the cost of WT+ is far less than the cost of Club World there is a big difference in seat comfort and the ability to get any real rest/sleep. On the other hand WT+ is far superior to what US airlines offer as their premium economy product (e.g. Delta ""economy comfort"" on its 767-300 on the same SEA to LHR route).",good

On the first flight over to USA  the cabin was not at full capacity and I tried other seating on other rows and experienced the same discomfort. Having been on both the inside and middle seating - there is no difference in comfort and I defy anyone to be seated in the middle seats as shown in the brochure in the seat pocket - I did try and it is impossible. Sleeping was almost non existent due to the headrest being too rigid.,bad

I had a window seat which cramped my shoulders and the foot area was cut by about 1/3. Trying to extend my legs the top of the opening hit mid-shin blocking access to the foot area. Exiting the seat was difficult. Worst plane seat experience ever. I am 5-11 and can't imagine the pain of someone taller. The only way to keep my knees from jamming against the seat in front was to sit as far back as possible and completely erect. On landing I slid forward and jammed both knees into the seatback hardware.,bad

The cabin was noisy cramped and the service was poor. To top it off the meals were barely edible. How can you give this airline 4 stars.

The customer service officer on the phone said I'd be happy with this seat as the flight had been reconfigured. Was not too sure what she meant until I boarded and realised I had a premium economy seat. These seats are very comfortable and I enjoyed the extra seat width and elbow room. Service was fantastic and because we were seated directly behind P/E the drinks cart was not too far away. The seat itself is nice good recline (compared to regular economy) and not knocking elbows is good. TV and table all located in arm rests and easily accessible. As I had the window side of the seats there is the ability to squeeze shoes pillow between seat and wall. Only let down is lack of storage so accessing books/magazines or toiletries I needed to access the locker each time.,good

There was plenty of room for the seat belt to fasten but the seat was at least six inches more narrow than I am. I am bruised from the cutting of the arm on the aisle seat which does not move. The tray table wouldn't lie flat because it was too close to my legs and stomach and my knees touched the seat in front of me (which had nothing to do with my weight) I suggest if you are a pound over 150 you do not consider this plane especially if you are on it for a long ride. (Our trip was 6.5 hours) I think the discomfort is on purpose because they will sell you an upgrade which gives you 4-6"" more legroom than the regular seats have. I had to upgrade because I became nearly claustrophobic thinking about having to climb back into that confined space. And tho the legroom helped and the fact that I was on the aisle instead of in the middle the seats were so narrow that I came off the plane with a six inch bruise from the armrest. It will be a long long time before I fly this plane again. All the ads in the world won't make up for the horrible experience of my two flights on a 757 between Dallas and Anchorage!",good

The leg room is spacious leaving enough work space so that I can work on my lap top without disturbing the person next to me - coach seating has become so cramped on airlines that you tend to overlap each other).

As soon as we sat down realized that these seats were narrower than the standard seats due to the fact that the entertainment remote is attached to the side of the seat rather than in the armrest. This was very uncomfortable sticking into my hip for the whole flight.. Also with no seat in front you are limited to where you can put items.

We had to pay for them but they were worth it on a long flight (LHR to KUL and return). Loads of space and no toilets close by so quiet. The extra leg room seats further back had toilets close by and had less space in front. Also row 73 which has two seats only on each side has no windows close by. The leg room generally looked okay but not over generous.,bad

First of all how can they be number 1 airline when economy seats are totally uncomfortable? Configuration 3x4x3 is too much because as a passenger you don't have enough space and also for cabin crew who are struggling to pass with all service trolleys. Also between the services you need to be careful not to be hit by cart on - knee leg or shoulder. As someone mentioned before it's so poor ambience when you see full cabin with all the luggage bags and poor cabin crew who don't have space for all this stuff. What are they willing to do just to have more money?,bad

When they introduced Premium Economy with the launch of the new A380, this was a fantastic new flying class in my opinion.  The amenities have been down-graded since then, but over all, I have found the staff on all my flights to be excellent.  I agree that the cost for PE has increased over the years, but if you keep your eye out for flight deals from Qantas and their partners, then the higher price compared to normal economy is not double.  Also if you have the option to book 2-3 months in advance of your travel date, then you also get the chance to select great seats (ie: Exit row, 24J). ",good

They have tray tables but only half the size they are on all other airlines I have flown on. I could not even thumb through a magazine due to the seat in front of me being reclined into my face. The seats were worn and felt like sitting on a metal bar. In flight service is horrible for a 8 hr flight. No meal service - just overpriced snacks. One star rating is overrated.,bad

Non-existent padding and next-to-no leg room made this a deeply unpleasant 12 hour journey and not one that I intend to repeat. In-flight entertainment is laughable - 1 large screen at the front of the cabin and a handful of smaller screens dotted about the place create lots of flicker which makes it even more difficult to sleep. I have absolutely no idea what Iberia think they are doing by fitting out brand new planes with such seats.,bad

Table was bent there for food tray tended to slide off was told to hold the tray in place to keep it from sliding. Cup holder broke on husbands knee when seat in front of him was reclined.

Leg room was fantastic but you do sort of angle a bit so it feels a bit odd twisting one way with your tv etc angled at the other but you get used to it - on the way back we were sat in the window seats and they are not like the middle ones they are off set from each other so there is more privacy I did find these ones had a little less room for your arm/elbow on the joining side but nothing major - there was also plenty of room to get in and out of your seat and it felt very spacious I was really impressed with the whole experience on this flight the seats the services everything was special and I highly recommend it.,good

Whoever ordered the seats need to speak with UA customers and ask their opinion. The reclining seat is hardly reclining and is one of the worst seats ever experienced on any airline. The 15 hour flight was most uncomfortable and sorry after 30 years flying UA cannot recommend this plane. If UA don't amend their seating am afraid many loyal UA flyers will seek alternative airlines to the USA.,bad

As noted in other posts the seats are rock-hard and the recline feature is either not functioning or awkward and uncomfortable. On both A380 and 777 they looked good from a distance but showed incredible wear and inattention to maintenance. In a word shabby. Customer service was nonexistent as to seat selection and my wife and I were arbitrarily separated on both LAX-CDG and return. No one could do anything about it despite requests weeks before the flights days before flights or at check-in. The only real benefit was the priority boarding but I'd rather save my money and upgrade to business. This is no alternative.,good

We were sat on the left hand side right over the engines (seats 24 A & B) which was very noisy and bumpy. The seats are some of the most uncomfortable I have ever sat in for an 8 hour flight with a leg rest that leaves your feet dangling and cuts into the calfs of your legs. When the seat in front was reclined I had 2 inches between my knees and the back of that seat. Because of the boxes around the chair anchor points I was made completely immobile with nowhere to put my feet and had to sit in a skewed position with both legs bent to the right. The food wasn't too good either. I ended the flight feeling very stiff and sore. I was expecting Premium Economy but only had Economy service.,bad

On landing preparation I asked the attendant to put the row 5 seat upright and he could not. .",bad

Access to the light and call buttons was difficult and poorly designed as they are on the inside of the armrest in a narrow seat. The recline was poor as was the leg rest which is poorly designed and doesn't do what it's supposed to do.

I have status with Air Canada but fly United while in the States. United made a mistake investing in these seats because it's only going to push business travelers and new travelers away. With the flexibility to choose airlines in the USA I would strongly urge United to not invest any more money into this bad idea. Shift investment to another style seat that all travelers in business or economy would feel more comfortable in. Just a suggestion but I think all would agree.,bad

Seats are small no TV or plugs just an old shared TV playing a terrible movie with terrible audio and no meal service. This was nearly an 8 hour flight and all they had were overpriced snacks for purchase. However if you were near the back of the plane the snacks ran out by the time they got to you so if you didn't bring anything you starve for 8 hours. Drink service came around maybe twice but other than that the flight attendants were mostly missing in action. They might as well have just tossed the passengers in with the luggage. A truly terrible experience and I will be avoiding American Airlines like the plague from now on.,bad

The front row just gets a cushion for their feet after take-off. I prefer the leg rests the other rows have as they are adjustable. The recline was pretty generous and I didn't feel too crowded when the seat in front of me was down. The seat width could've been a bit wider. I had some room but if you are a larger individual you will fill up the seat. With my seat reclined and my feet on the leg rest in the top position I was almost all the way stretched out. (I am 5'6"") I found it very comfortable. For 2 people the side rows are great. They are just two seats and we felt like it was our own little area. Getting out of the window seat was pretty good. The VOD system was pretty good. They had a seat-to-seat text chat feature and games you can play against other passengers. The movie selection was good. They provide noise-canceling headphones and they worked very well. Welcome drink menu for meals attentive crew and self-service bar is awesome! There was always water juice beer wine rum and soda available also bags of potato chips. The premium section also has it's own restrooms - large and clean. Welcome kit included eye cover blanket toothbrush socks etc. I was very impressed with Premium Economy and thought it was well worth it for a 16 hour flight.",good

The downfall here is it's location to the bathroom in peak times numerous would wait in front of our seat which was annoying. Flight back seats where great I am 6foot 2 and had no issue even when seat in front was at full recline. I got past my travelling partner without the need for them to get up however if the person is unknown to you probably best to ask them to get up. Food was fantastic highly recommend the Q Eat option so you can pre select your main meal prior to travel there is also a pre select only option which was fantastic. Sleep quality good pillow was of amble size & blanket of a high quality. Cabin nice & quiet with very attentive cabin crew. All in all highly recommended.,bad

If the center one could have been raised to make more room it would have helped a lot. I could not really stretch out because of a metal box under the seat in front of me.

This means that it is the only window seat that is also an aisle seat. However the tray table is the bulkhead variety and is flimsy. The table slopes towards the left hand side when loaded. This is a problem when eating during turbulence as any liquid will almost certainly slide off the tray - this happened to me! The seat area is very draughty and cold - maybe just the bad flight I was on. The distance between the seat and the window is large meaning several pillows are required to bridge the gap (and support your head). I do not recommend paying extra for this seat unless you are over 6 foot tall and will benefit from the leg room. Might also be a good option for young families - kids can come and go without disrupting parents in 74B/C.,good

While the seats in this class are far superior to those in coach class there are drawbacks. The fixed seat shell is marvelous as passengers do not encroach into other passengers' space but the recline mechanism could be improved to provide greater comfort. I fly the LAX-CDG route annually and it is annoying that on every trip the passenger sitting behind me kept their window shades open or kept their reading light on throughout the flight. There should be a period during the flight when passengers should be able to sleep. The service as always (at least in my experience flying AF) is superior. The food can be questionable but I will likely order the special meals for my next trip which appear to be superior to the standard meals offered.,good

We tried to book exit seats because I am nearly 6.3 (190cm) tall but not succeeded. Then we got seats from row 23. Plane was full and no way to get other seats. No leg room at all. Knees were locked to front seat and when passenger sitting on front seat reclined it pain in my legs was terrible. I couldn't move anywhere and no way to put tray down at all. Seats are so narrow that I even couldn't turn sideways to help my position.,bad

I was in seat 27G which is the second row of Economy seats now the reason for the extra legroom is the fact that the plane layout goes from a 2x3x2 to a 2x4x2 in row 27. Seat G is basically halfway in the aisle. however the rest of the row is god awful because the seats aren't perfectly aligned and therefore every seat has immovable armrests for tray tables but the video screens are still on the seat in front giving a very crooked view. Honestly it is the most aggravating thing. Another huge reason for the low score is the bathrooms. Lufthansa has a neat little feature where they place all economy bathrooms downstairs on the bottom deck. This is really cool however there are only 5 of them. The flight attendants also have to guard the stairs to make sure that crowding doesn't occur. They vigilantly stand guard and make sure a line of no more than 5 people forms (which happens rather quickly). Almost impossible to use the restroom.,bad

The seat is a little wider and there is a little more legroom than in economy class but for an over night flight not really much more comfortable. The man in the aisle seat next to me put on his eye shields and the blanket over his head as soon as the plane took off. he ate no meals. It was with the greatest difficulty that I was able to get out of the seat to reach the aisle particularly when the seat in front was reclined in fact almost impossible. The TV screen is very small and in my case fell out of it's housing and despite efforts by the crew to hold it in place with sticky tape they were not successful. The food was good and better than ordinary economy. But I did not consider the extra money for the premium class seat well spent for a single traveller. It would be better for a party of two who could choose the seats at the side.,good

Normally fly BA Qantas or Singapore Airlines but the bargain fare offered by Etihad out of UK attracted me. Now I know why they are cheap (cheaper than Emirates or Qatar as well) - the conditions are simply awful and the cabin is just cramped and claustrophobic. Anyone else that may be tempted by their bargain basement fares - please think about what you might get - its not good and pay a little more for a better airline. They endlessly plug an award at Etihad and on close inspection it seems that Abu Dhabi oil dollars might be more important than merit!,bad

The backs are thinner making every movement and touch from behind felt immediately. The seats recline beautifully - except the lovely recline means you are lying in someone's lap and someone is probably lying in your lap. This makes sitting up and reading impossible if the person in front of you goes to sleep before you do. The entertainment screen is also too close to see clearly as soon the seat in front of you is reclined. Lucky for me the gentleman in front of me was asked to raise his seat back so I could eat. The seats themselves are barely wide enough to sit in. There is less leg room than any other flight I've been on in my life. To eat requires the capacity to keep one's arms glued to one's sides while wielding a fork and knife so one is not elbow jousting with the neighbor. The tray table is so small it barely fits the tiny food tray which is all of about 9 x 5 inches. The entertainment screen remote is tucked away in the arm between the seats so you have to ask the person next to you to move his arm to retrieve it. Then you have to slam the armrest lid down on the attached cord without breaking it. I just kept the remote out and hanging off the edge of my seat so I didn't have to bother that poor guy again. The armrests also do not raise all the way so if you are fortunate enough to have an empty seat next to you you can't get rid of it and stretch out a bit more or rest your head against the next seat.I weigh 100 lbs/about 47 kg. I am thin and not tall. This seat was uncomfortable for me. Now imagine what it is like for any normal human. I will keep flying Qantas but I will never be booked onto an A380 again unless I win the lottery and can go first class. (probably not going to happen?),bad

The service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew the meals weren't fine dining and improvements can be made but I would recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft however what we received was extremely good. I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. We had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion.,bad

No seat padding they also seem to have narrower seats than the old style. But what really bugs me is that we have to use the same loos as the 200+ people behind me nothing personal but it's yucky. I couldn't eat either meal choice so got stitched with an economy meal. Miserable Staff as well.,bad

You have good view of the screen with good inflight entertainment. In the sleeping position however it is torture. The back support could not be adjusted the bottom seat slides forwards a few inches instead. There isn't a great sleeping position. You just get neck problems whilst sleeping and need to support your neck whist waking up. For long haul flights and for sleep these are absolutely the worst seats.,bad

My perceptions of the level of comfort may be slightly different as I am 5' 1"" and was seated next to a small child however my husband (5' 11"") also found the seating as comfortable as on economy class on any other scheduled European airline. This row is immediately behind the one behind a bulkhead (i.e. behind the row often given to families - we were lucky to have a quiet family in front who slept as well as we did). Passengers on those rows generally do not recline their seats so much due to the extra space in front of them consequently we in turn did not feel so trapped in our seats as passengers further back may have done - our seats did not recline as much as some on other aircraft but we did not find this a problem. Worth mentioning that the food was excellent too!",good

Yes we had extra leg room but as the extra leg room was also the queuing area for the main toilets my feet were constantly trod on and I had to keep my feet tucked tightly into the seat. The four main toilets were about two feet from my seat. They were constantly in use and many times the users would open the door before flushing the toilet. The smell was awful. There was a curtain to block my direct view into the toilets but staff kept it open even after I had asked if it would be closed during sleeping time. Many people coming out of the toilets used my seat head rest to hold on to and elbows were inches from my head. There was nowhere to put personal belongings. I was handed a meal tray and then I had to pull a very old tray from the side of the seat to place it on and then told I must fasten my seat belt .This was a task requiring many hands. The staff were off hand and spent a lot of time chatting .First and last time on Virgin Atlantic.,bad

I consider myself to be of average build and height and fairly fit yet squeezing into the seat was incredibly difficult. There was approximately one inch of space between my knees and the seat in front far less than the majority of short-haul flights I make. Extricating myself from the seat to get to the bathroom involved disturbing the two people sat next to me who were forced to get out of their seat and pile into the galley area because I wanted to leave. After the problems I faced when I first attempt to get out of my seat I gave in and remained stationary for the remainder of the flight. I dread to think how unpleasant the flight would have been if I was over 6 feet or weighed more than average. I have since recommended that all of my friends and colleagues avoid Air France at all costs.,bad

Check in staff rude and unprofessional, even to First Class passengers. Aircraft dirty and tired, with no entertainment. WIFI either slow or inoperative. Food in First Class has slightly improved. Seats in First Class grim, old fashioned, and barely qualify as Premium Economy comfort on quality airlines. Crews were mainly indifferent, and just going through the motions. Uniforms and airplanes grubby. What is missing from AA First Class is just that - class. A new livery is merely veneer. This airline needs a major cultural overhaul, from top to bottom. I doubt it is capable of change. At least they are buying newer aircraft. The First Class product is desperately poor. Shame on a once great national airline!",bad

I had my eye on 38J and K (exit row rear right of the cabin) and managed to get them there and back. This gave us (me + wife) masses of legroom so that wasn't an issue. Recline is OK and we managed a decent amount of sleep though it still felt like airline sleep rather than truly restful sleep. Food was ordinary in truth though nicely served on linen china etc. Staff were excellent on three of the four legs. We were addressed by name on several occasions by smiling crew. On SYD-SIN leg the Customer Services Manager walked around and met everyone in the cabin shook hands and thanked us for flying with Qantas -then repeated this as we approached SIN! Premium Economy cabin is quite close to the tail so lateral movement is quite noticeable during turbulence. IFE is first-class; touch- screen intuitive interface and loads of choice. First time I've taken more than a passing interest. Only disappointment was that the screen has to be stowed during take-off and landing - precisely when the Skycam in the tail is at its most entertaining so you can't watch that part of the proceedings. And finally beware - while these two seats are the best in the cabin for legroom they are also the chilliest. This may be because they are near the galley which has to be cooled or it may be that it's next to the door - though I can't believe this would be the cause of a draught! In any case it was much warmer a few rows forward and we had to cover up well in the excellent blankets to avoid the worst of it and still there was an uncomfortably cool draught on our faces. This was true on both trips (both A380s but different aircraft). So while I'd recommend Premium Economy I'm not sure this is the best place to sit. The ultimate measure is that my wife suffered a lot less from her usual terminal jetlag (we've done this trip quite a lot) and said she would do it again which is not true of 'standard' Economy (there's no going back to Economy now).,good

With 34 inches and a good recline it is amongst the best seats in economy. The downside is the pitiful central TV screen apparently they are updating their aircraft soon so the LHR-BKK sector has an avod system. II managed to sleep for nearly 8 hours on the BKK-LHR a record for me. At 6 foot tall leg room is very important.,bad

It's padding was lacking (despite that I'm slightly below average weight) and the legroom was a little too tight (despite being average height). There was also very little under-seat storage. The seats were fine for short-haul flights in Europe but very hard on the rear and spine for the transatlantic flight.,good

On the way back we flew BA from MIA-LHR and it was really bad I do not recommend sitting in row 33-36 as the leg room is reduced and the seats are uncomfortable I had a headphone set that didn't work and a box under the seat in front of me so I didn't have any leg room for my left foot now me being 6ft something and as a 15 year old teenager who likes a bit of leg room found it difficult to find some. I had flown from PLS-MIA before that flight to LHR but couldn't get any sleep because of the most uncomfortable chairs. I am willing to give BA another go but I might go premium economy or even club world. Not a good flight at all do not sit in seat 35G!,bad

These are ""preferred"" seats and need to be booked in advance on the SIA website for a charge of $50 per sector. Well worth the extra as there is no one in front of you and the emergency exit does not intrude from the side (as it does on a 747). I think these are actually better that the exit seats further back on the upper deck as no one came up and stood in front of us on either flight whereas further back people milled around waiting for the toilet. The toilets next to our seats were for business class and curtained off so no one came to look out of the window from there. Seat was OK on the outward journey but felt quite hard and was somewhat uncomfortable towards the end of the return flight (This was probably because I had already sat on a 777-200ER for 10 hours with very hard seats!). Flight felt quite hot on the way back (although there were several people with blankets and jumpers so it may just have been me. I did discover 2 fresh air vents around the emergency exit door which improved matters considerably so it is worth looking for these. A380 noticably quieter that the 777. Food and service excellent as was the AVOD. I woulld certainly choose this airline/aircraft/seat in the future if at all possible.",good

My main issue with the seats are that there was hardly any thickness to the bottom cushion of the seat so this made for a numbing 23.5 hours so much so that I was hardly able to sleep at all during the entire flight. I estimate that there was approximately only 2.5 inches of padding between the top to the mesh metal base of the seat. The B747 on the outgoing leg of the journey was a lot more bearable. Whoever gave these seats a Design Award must have had no sense feeling from the waist down or actually sat in them for a very short period of time. The only reason why I would recommend this seat would be for the extra leg room apart from that it is a very uncomfortable experience.,bad

I have never been so uncomfortable on a long haul flight. The seats are hard they don't recline very well and there is nothing to support your head when you want to sleep. On the 747 the head rests come round so you have something nice to lean on and the seats seemed more padded. The A330 seats were so hard not even my 7 year old got any sleep. The entertainment is okay but nothing to write home about and the food was pretty awful. I used to think Virgin were the best but having flown Emirates a few times Emirates are far superior.

About 2 hours into a flight from Charlotte NC to Phoenix AZ my body was screaming to get out of the seat. My poor husband who is quite tall was miserable as well. This was one flight I couldn't wait to get off of it was that bad. The seat was hard and confining; the leg room stingy. The guy behind me continuously hit my seat back doing what I don't know. The woman in front of me used her seat back to bounce back and forth throughout the entire flight. Why? Because they just didn't have enough room. The space they allot you in your seat is pitiful and painful. Twice I had the cart hit my knee as it was pushed by and several times I had people brush up against me as they walked past because there is so little room in the aisle. Why is this acceptable for air travel? By the time we got off the plane my husband's feet and ankles were severely swollen and he does not normally have a problem with ankle/feet swelling. Really kind of scary the physical abuse you have to tolerate in order to fly from one part of the country to the other. I can't imagine flying on a plane like this on an international flight. It would be intolerable unless you are built like an 8 year-old.",bad
